        <h2>What is a View?</h2>
          <p>
          If you primarily use Object Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks for interacting with your database, you may not be familiar
          with the concept of a View and why you would want to use it.
          <br/>
          First, let's look at the official documentation.
          </p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createview.html">
            CREATE VIEW defines a view of a query. The view is not physically materialized. Instead, the query is run every time the view is referenced in a query.
            <footer>
              <cite><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createview.html">PostgreSQL 16 Documentation</a></cite>
            </footer>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
          At a basic level, a View is a "pre-defined query" that you interact with like a table.
          Views are a convenient way to collect raw <em>data</em> from multiple tables (or just one) and format it into useful <em>information</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
          Instead of relying on application code to format data - consider using a View. By moving your logic closer to the data, you simplify your application code and centralize it for easy reuse across other applications.

      <section id="create-view" class="blog">
        <h2>Creating a View</h2>
        <p>
        Creating a basic View is really as simple as defining a select query. This example is simple, but anything you can do with a <code>SELECT</code> query, you can use in a View.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-sql" tabindex="0">create table artists (
  id         bigint primary key generated always as identity,
  first_name text not null,
  last_name  text not null 
);

create table albums (
  id        bigint primary key generated always as identity,
  name      text not null,
  artist_id bigint not null references artist (id)
);

create view artist_albums as 
select artist.first_name  as artist_first_name,
       artist.last_name   as artist_last_name,
       artist.id          as artist_id,
       album.id           as album_id,
       album.name         as album_name
from  artists artist
join  albums album
using (id);
</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="select-view" class="blog">
        <h2>SELECT from a View</h2>
        Easy.
        <pre><code class="language-sql">select * from artist_albums;</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="insert-view" class="blog">
        <h2>INSERT INTO a View</h2>
        <p>
          Performing <code>INSERT</code> operations are where Views begin to differ from a Table. For <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS">a Simple View</a>,
          everything works as you would expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the View defined in <a href="#create-view">the first example</a> is <em>not</em> considered a Simple View because of the <code>JOIN</code> clause. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> statements cannot be used on the View. Create a function that returns a trigger that contains the logic to perform the insert/update/delete, and then a define a trigger to overwrite the default behavior.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-sql">-- create a function to be used in a trigger when an insert occurs
create or replace function insert_artist_albums() returns trigger as $$
  begin
    -- create an artist and store into a temporary table called artist
    with artist as (
      insert into artists (first_name, last_name)
      -- new represents the values from the view
      select new.artist_first_name, new.artist_last_name 
      on conflict do nothing
      returning *
    )

    insert into albums (name, artist_id)
    -- now we can get the id from the newly created artist
    select new.album_name, (select id from artist)
    -- always think about your strategy for handling conflicts
    on conflict do nothing;

    return new;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;

create trigger insert_artist_albums_trigger
  -- this trick allows us to insert into the view
  for each row execute function insert_artist_albums();

-- example
insert into artist_albums
(artist_first_name, artist_last_name, album_name)
VALUES ('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
</code></pre>
      <p>
      Writing your first few functions and
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createtrigger.html">triggers</a> takes practice,
      but they are not much different than what you would do in application code.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the above example, we have two clear steps to the function: insert a new artist, then insert the album. Just like in application code, we must store the
      artist we create into a "temporary" variable using a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html#QUERIES-WITH">WITH</a> clause in order to reference the newly created artist ID.
      </p>

        <h2>Views &amp; Row Level Security</h2>
        <p>
        Covering the details of Row Level Security (RLS) is outside the scope of this post. Check out <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security">Supabase's Guide on RLS</a> for an overview.
        </p>
        <p>
        By default, Views <strong>do not respect the RLS policies of underlying Tables.</strong>
        Add the <code>SECURITY INVOKER = true</code> clause when creating a View to ensure your RLS policies work as expected.
        <em>This only works in Postgres 15 and above. Earlier versions of Postgres require you to <a href="https://www.benburwell.com/posts/row-level-security-postgresql-views/">implement a function.</a></em>

      <section id="why-views" class="blog">
        <h2>Why use Views?</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest benefit I have seen since using Views is the separation of <em>data</em> from <em>information.</em> This split allows me to evolve the Table schemas while maintaining consistency at the View level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider a change to the name of a column. If you change a column name, now you need to update all your application code to respect the new column name.
          If you have a View that defines an alias for the column using an <code>AS</code> clause, you only need to update the any references to the column within the View and any related functions. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A pattern I use to evolve my Views is to define versions schemas like <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code>. Tables stay in schemas related to their domain, while Views exist under a version schema. "Major" updates to a View, that would break existing integrations, requires the creation of new View under a later version.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connected clients can gradually adopt the new version of the View - no different than a well-versioned API.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more integrations you have to your database, the more value Views provide. Retool, your backend, data analysts, etc., all benefit from well defined Views.
