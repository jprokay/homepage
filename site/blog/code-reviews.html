        <h2>Catching Snowflakes</h2>
          <p>
            Winning your first enterprise contract is a huge achievement that comes with many risks for a startup. You are now contractually obligated to provide both software
            and <em>possibly 24/7 support</em> with only a small team. You are not solving software problems, you are solving operational problems. As a technical leader,
            it will be up to you to navigate the relationship with the enterprise IT department and the wide range of requirements they may have to approve your software.
          </p>
          <p>
            These requests can vary widly in complexity. Some departments will be satisfied with only a SOC2 Type 2 certificate while others require that you have immutable database
            backups and robust audit logs. Each customer will be different, and it is key that you form a good relationship with them. From my experience, they <em>want</em> to approve you,
            but they must protect their business - work to earn their trust and always be collaborative.
          </p>

          <p>
            That is all I am qualified to say on the social aspect, but I can offer you some advice on how to design your software architecture to maximize your success.

        <h2>Preparing your database</h2>
        <p>
          Network security is clearly important to any enterprise, but a close second is how you manage your data. While you want a multi-tenant architecture, your white whale wants their own
          database. If you are lucky, this is simply a logical separation. Others want infrastructure.</p>

      <section id="cmake-detour" class="blog">
        <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
          <p>
            The short answer: stick to the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and avoid leveraging too many 3rd party PaaS services. SOC2 requires that you audit your contracts with your providers and
            ensure they also meet certain compliance standards if they handle sensitive data. Many providers upcharge for these guarantees - it is not uncommon for your bill to go up 10x or more for their
            <em>"SOC2 Compliant"</em>tier. AWS (my cloud of choice) does not require nearly as large an investment in capital, but will require more of your time to properly configure your infrastructure.

        <p>
          Performing <code>INSERT</code> operations are where Views begin to differ from a Table. For <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS">a Simple View</a>,
          everything works as you would expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the View defined in <a href="#create-view">the first example</a> is <em>not</em> considered a Simple View because of the <code>JOIN</code> clause. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> statements cannot be used on the View. Create a function that returns a trigger that contains the logic to perform the insert/update/delete, and then a define a trigger to overwrite the default behavior.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-c">bool game_init(struct Game *game) {
	if (!SDL_SetAppMetadata(APP_NAME, APP_VERSION, APP_ID)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Failed to set metadata: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return false;
	};
	if (!SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Failed to initialized SDL: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return false;
	};	

	game->window = SDL_CreateWindow(WIN_TITLE, WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT, SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE|SDL_WINDOW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP);
	if (!game->window) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create window: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return false;
	}

	game->renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(game->window, NULL);

      <p>
      Writing your first few functions and
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createtrigger.html">triggers</a> takes practice,
      but they are not much different than what you would do in application code.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the above example, we have two clear steps to the function: insert a new artist, then insert the album. Just like in application code, we must store the
      artist we create into a "temporary" variable using a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html#QUERIES-WITH">WITH</a> clause in order to reference the newly created artist ID.

        <h2>Views &amp; Row Level Security</h2>
        <p>
        Covering the details of Row Level Security (RLS) is outside the scope of this post. Check out <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security">Supabase's Guide on RLS</a> for an overview.
        </p>
        <p>
        By default, Views <strong>do not respect the RLS policies of underlying Tables.</strong>
        Add the <code>SECURITY INVOKER = true</code> clause when creating a View to ensure your RLS policies work as expected.
        <em>This only works in Postgres 15 and above. Earlier versions of Postgres require you to <a href="https://www.benburwell.com/posts/row-level-security-postgresql-views/">implement a function.</a></em>
        </p>

      <section id="basic-events" class="blog">
        <h2>Why use Views?</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest benefit I have seen since using Views is the separation of <em>data</em> from <em>information.</em> This split allows me to evolve the Table schemas while maintaining consistency at the View level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider a change to the name of a column. If you change a column name, now you need to update all your application code to respect the new column name.
          If you have a View that defines an alias for the column using an <code>AS</code> clause, you only need to update the any references to the column within the View and any related functions. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A pattern I use to evolve my Views is to define versions schemas like <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code>. Tables stay in schemas related to their domain, while Views exist under a version schema. "Major" updates to a View, that would break existing integrations, requires the creation of new View under a later version.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connected clients can gradually adopt the new version of the View - no different than a well-versioned API.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more integrations you have to your database, the more value Views provide. Retool, your backend, data analysts, etc., all benefit from well defined Views.
