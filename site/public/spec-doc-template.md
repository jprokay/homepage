# SPEC-NUMBER SPEC-NAME
<!-- Example: PROJ-001-User-Authentication-System -->

## Problem Statement
<!-- What specific problem are we solving? Why is this important? -->

## Goals & Success Metrics
<!-- What outcomes do we want? How will we measure success? 
Be specific and measurable. This helps AI understand priorities. -->

## Current State
<!-- What exists now? What codebase patterns should AI follow?
Include key files, existing patterns, or architectural decisions to build upon. -->

## Scope
<!-- Constrain the scope as needed. Most important to highlight out of scope -->

### Out
<!-- What we are not doing -->

## External Integrations
<!-- APIs, services, or systems this project will interact with.
Focus on interface contracts and integration points, not team dependencies. -->

## Key Constraints & Open Questions
<!-- Technical constraints, design patterns to follow, or areas needing exploration.
Use this to guide AI on where you need proposals or alternative approaches. -->

## High-Level Design / Technical Approach
<!-- Briefly describe the proposed technical solution, architectural changes, or key design decisions
This should provide enough context for engineers to understand the overall approach 
before diving into individual stories. Include key technical choices and rationale. -->

## Implementation Approach
<!-- High-level breakdown of work. Each item here becomes a GitHub issue.
Track status via GitHub Projects, not in this document. -->

### Feature: FEATURE-NAME
<!-- Example: User Password Reset -->
<!-- Brief description of the feature -->

#### Core Requirements
<!-- What must this feature do? Clear, atomic requirements. -->

#### AI Implementation Notes
<!-- Specific guidance for AI: preferred patterns, libraries to use/avoid,
performance considerations, or code style preferences. -->

## Appendix
<!-- Diagrams, data models, API specs, or other reference materials -->
