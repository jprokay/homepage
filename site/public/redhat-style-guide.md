# [⁠]()Preface

## [⁠]()1. Audience

This guide is the official style guide for Red Hat training and certification content, and for all other technical documentation except as stated. Red Hat product documentation follows the Red Hat supplementary style guide at [https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/) instead of this guide.

The Red Hat Technical Writing Style Guide includes guidance for everyday punctuation and grammar, common mistakes and how to avoid them, strategies for translation and global audiences, content design guidance, and a word usage dictionary.

This guide is a public and open source guide. It is reviewed and maintained primarily by Red Hat. Contributions from the wider community are always welcome.

Other resources for technical writing are listed in [Chapter 7, *Resources*](#resources). Of these resources, [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** is available for Red Hat employees to access online, but does not have a wider circulation. Links in this guide to [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) are denoted by a padlock icon **![](images/padlock.png)** .

## [⁠]()Chapter 1. Objectives of this Guide

The objective of the Red Hat Style Guide is to help authors communicate information in a clear, transparent fashion, and to facilitate consistency in tone and delivery. We write documentation for various audiences, across multiple geographies and with different skill sets. We write for end users as well as expert users. Red Hat documentation is:

- Accurate and consistent.
- Readable, with a score of 60-70 on the Flesch-Kincaid reading ease scale.
- Comprehensible, with a fog index of 9-12, using the Gunning fog index.
- User focused, providing information without patronizing the reader, or making presumptions about their skills.

[⁠]()

Readability

Technical documents should be readable by the targeted audience. In this instance, we expect our audiences to have the minimum reading and comprehension level of an eighth-grade student, of an age between 14 and 15 years. The Flesch-Kincaid and Gunning Fog index provide measurable grades. A Red Hat guide should have a Gunning Fog index of 9-12.

This section contains information on a few common grammar topics. For subjects not covered here, consult The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition.

## [⁠]()2.1. Active Voice

Use the active voice ("Type ... to start Linuxconf") rather than passive ("Linuxconf can be started by typing ...") whenever possible. Active voice makes for more lively, interesting reading. It is more compelling than passive voice and helps to reduce word count.

This does not mean that the passive voice is forbidden. There are situations when using the passive voice is appropriate, such as release notes, technical notes, and similar material.

For example, the sentence, "The Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources, has been introduced to the OpenShift website." reads better than

"The OpenShift website introduces the Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources." Here, the passive voice is better because the important issue ("The Developer Center") is the subject of the sentence.

You can also use the passive voice to front-load important keywords in key areas of your content, such as the title, heading, or at the beginning of a paragraph or sentence. You need to make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing the importance of front-loading keywords against content that is readable (that is, not awkward sounding). Consider the following two examples:

[⁠]()

**Example 2.1. Active Voice**

"Dutch hosting provider Oxilion launches *public cloud* service based on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization."

[⁠]()

**Example 2.2. Passive Voice**

"*Public cloud* service based on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization launched by Dutch hosting provider Oxilion."

## [⁠]()2.2. Agreement

In grammar, agreement occurs when specific parts of a sentence are coordinated; that is, they agree in number and gender.

There are two forms of agreement: *subject-verb agreement* and *pronoun-antecedent agreement*. Subject-verb agreement is pretty rudimentary, and is not discussed here. Pronoun-antecedent agreement can be a little more problematic, so...

### [⁠]()2.2.1. Pronoun-antecedent agreement

A *pronoun* is a word that is used in place of a noun (for example, I, he, she, it). An *antecedent* is a word or phrase to which the pronoun refers.

When you are comfortable with subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement often follows as a matter of course.

The following is an annotated roundup of pronoun-antecedent rules:

[⁠]()

Singular and Plural Nouns

A singular pronoun refers to a singular antecedent; a plural pronoun refers to a plural antecedent. For example:

- The CD spins in *its* caddy. (The singular third-person pronoun "its" refers to the singular antecedent "CD".)
- The developers checked *their* work. (The plural third-person pronoun "their" refers to the plural antecedent "developers".)

[⁠]()

Collective Nouns

When collective nouns are used as antecedents, use singular or plural pronouns, depending on the sentence's meaning. For example:

- Microsoft seems second to none in *its* marketing skills. (The collective noun "Microsoft" takes the singular pronoun "its" because the collective noun refers to the group as a whole.)
- The developers were asked for *their* preferences. (The collective noun "developers" takes the plural pronoun "their" because the reference is to the individuals of the group.)

## [⁠]()2.3. Countable Nouns

For nouns that are not countable, it is correct to use "less" and "amount", for example "less memory" or "the required amount of memory". For nouns that are countable, use "fewer" instead of "less", and use "number" instead of "amount".

[⁠]()

**Table 2.1.** 

 Example Improvement This passphrase configuration can improve security by providing less opportunities for someone else to see you type the passphrase. This passphrase configuration can improve security by providing fewer opportunities for someone else to see you type the passphrase. Vim has fast, efficient keystrokes to delete an exact amount of words, lines, sentences, or paragraphs. Vim has fast, efficient keystrokes to delete an exact number of words, lines, sentences, or paragraphs.

## [⁠]()2.4. Possessives

A *possessive* indicates that something or someone belongs to a person or thing.

For guidance on how to form a possessive, refer to [Section 2.9.6, “Apostrophes”](#apostrophes).

Do not use possessives with product names.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.2.** 

 Example Improvement Red Hat OpenShift's Logging operator creates cluster logging and cluster log forwarder instances. The Red Hat OpenShift Logging operator creates cluster logging and cluster log forwarder instances. OpenSauced's Chrome Extension is a good tool to display your open source contributions. The OpenSauced Chrome Extension is a good tool to display your open source contributions.

Do not use possessives with abbreviations.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.3.** 

 Example Improvement You can find NASA's documentation on GitHub. You can find NASA documentation on GitHub.

You can use the possessive form with the "Red Hat" company name to refer only to the company itself, without identifying any products or services.

*Examples:*

- Use the "DEI" term to refer to Red Hat's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and teams.
- Red Hat's approach to hybrid cloud security helps customers implement security across their entire infrastructure.

Otherwise, you can use possessives for people and inanimate objects.

*Examples:*

- Eddie Jaoude's YouTube channel is one of the best sources for learning how to use GitHub.
- The alt tag's text for the Pepsi logo is too short.

## [⁠]()2.5. Using Who, Whom, That, and Which Correctly

Use "whom" or "who" to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a person. Use "that" or "which" when referring to a thing. Use "which" or "that" to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a concept or an object. Who, whom, that, and which are known as "relative pronouns".

Use the following as guidelines:

[⁠]() Who

Relative pronoun when persons are the subject.

[⁠]() Whom

Relative pronoun when persons are not the subject.

[⁠]() Which

Relative pronoun for things.

[⁠]() That

Restrictive pronoun for things.

*Examples:*

- The jewel case, which previously held the CD, was broken recently.
- The CD that I received for my birthday is defective.
- Edward C. Bailey, who wrote "Maximum RPM",...
- The company that published "Maximum RPM" was...
- This book belongs to whomever purchased it last week.
- Who ate all the cereal?
- To whom should I address the letter?
- The desktop that was designed by Earl is not called GNOME.
- The GNOME developers who worked on the desktop are...
- The GNOME developers to whom they owe gratitude are...

**Note**

To help you choose between *who* and *whom*, substitute the person about whom you are speaking with *he*, *she*, *him*, or *her*.

- If your restatement contains *him*, *her*, *them*, *me*, or *us*, then use *whom* or *whomever*. "I'm giving the book to him." "To whom am I giving the book?"
- If the restatement contains the word *he*, *she*, *they*, *I*, or *we*, then use *who* or *whoever*. "Do you think he would mind?" "Who do you think would mind?" "She's walking in the door." "Who's walking in the door?"

## [⁠]()2.6. Sentence Structure

A *sentence* is one complete thought. A sentence expresses something about a subject (a person, place, or thing) and a verb (what the subject is or does).

Consider the following points when constructing sentences:

[⁠]()

Sentence Length

Try not to pack too much information into one sentence. In technical documentation, try not to exceed 40 words in a sentence. Keep it short. The following sentence is a bad writing example:

The **Start** button, which you can find in the bottom left corner of your screen (also activated by the "Windows key" on your keyboard, the one between the **Ctrl** and **Alt** keys), provides a central starting point for applications and tasks, and can be customized according to your individual preferences so that it presents menu items relevant to you instead of presenting the standard items that come with the default installation of the operating system, items which, in my opinion, are irrelevant for most users these days who really only need access to an internet browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

The following paragraph is a suggested improvement to the previous long sentence:

The **Start** button provides a starting point for any applications or tasks on your Windows system. Either click **Start** or press the **Windows** key to activate the **Start** menu. You can customize the **Start** menu to suit your own preferences.

[⁠]()

Preposition at the End of a Sentence

Allow a preposition at the end of a sentence to avoid otherwise awkward wording.

For example, instead of "Click the workspace to which you want to switch", which can sound stilted, it flows better to use "Click the workspace to switch to".

[⁠]()

Run-on Sentences

Two or more complete ideas that are joined without punctuation, or separated only by a comma, create a *run-on sentence* (also called a *fused sentence*). The sentence does not have to be long to be a run-on sentence, although the longer the sentence the more difficult it is to read. You can:

- Separate independent clauses with a period. This creates two sentences from one.
- Use semicolons to form a compound sentence. Think of a semicolon as an extended breather; it is longer than a comma.
- Insert a *coordinating conjunction*, such as "and" or "but", between the independent clauses to form a compound sentence. For example, "The process starts, but it produces an error."
- Insert a *subordinating conjunction*, such as "although" or "because", which forms a compound sentence with a subordinate clause. For example, "Although the process starts, it produces an error."

[⁠]()

**Table 2.4.** 

 Example Improvement The CDs both of which belonged to the developers were in the test lab. The CDs, both of which belonged to the developers, were in the test lab. To access your programs click the **Start** button. To access your programs, click **Start**. The CDs, both of which belonged to the developers, were in the test lab, because they were the only available CDs for the new release, the developers were anxious about keeping them clean. (This sentence exhibits a *comma splice* which is also often regarded as a run-on sentence.) The CDs, both of which belonged to the developers, were in the test lab. Because they were the only available CDs for the new release, the developers were anxious about keeping them clean.

[⁠]()

Sentence Fragments

A *sentence fragment* is an incomplete sentence. For example, "Red Hat releases no upgrade before its time." is a complete sentence, whereas in "We will release no upgrade. At least, before its time." the second of the two sentences is a fragment. Repair sentence fragments by making them complete sentences.

**Note**

Read your sentences aloud, as if each sentence were the \*only* sentence on paper. If you hear a sentence that does not make any sense by itself, then it is probably a sentence fragment.

[⁠]()

Telegraphic Style

Extreme cases of word economy can result in a telegraphic style, omitting words that can clarify the meaning of a sentence, such as articles, prepositions, and verbs used with gerunds.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.5.** 

 Example Improvement Click button to start. Click **Start** to start the process.

This problem is often encountered in the Revision History. It is important that wording in the Revision History is clear for translators and customers to understand.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.6.** 

 Example Improvement Minor revision - missing element items Minor revision - added missing element items Some further work required to avoid 404s at lower levels of the SDK. Some further work required to avoid 404 errors at lower levels of the SDK.

[⁠]()

Causative Verbs

Avoid the construction "have something happen". Rewrite to replace "have" with a verb that describes the actual action.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.7.** 

 Example Improvement The latter connection has no devices assigned. No devices are assigned to the latter connection. To have the changes take effect … To apply the changes …

[⁠]()

The Either-Or Construction

Use the "either x ... or y" construction only to refer to a choice between two options, not for three or more options.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.8.** 

 Example Improvement Scale up by adding more resources, with either more memory, CPUs, or disk space. Scale up by adding more resources, such as memory, CPUs, or disk space.

[⁠]()

Use of Following

Use "following" with a noun. In a quiz question, "the following" is often superfluous.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.9.** 

 Example Improvement Non-privileged users can use the role to configure the following: Non-privileged users can use the role to configure the following interfaces: Which two of the following statements describe the benefits of Linux? Which two statements describe the benefits of Linux?

[⁠]()

The If-Then Construction

Generally, follow an "if" statement with a "then" statement.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.10.** 

 Example Improvement If one service is started, the other is also started. If one service is started, then the other is also started.

[⁠]()

Including That in Clauses

Include the word "that" in clauses unless it results in writing that is too formal or stilted. Including the conjunction "that" makes the sentence easier to translate and improves clarity for readers whose primary language is not English.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.11.** 

 Example Improvement Verify your directory service is working. Verify that your directory service is working.

[⁠]()

Use of This That These Those

Use "this", "that", "these", or "those" followed by a noun. Doing so improves clarity for readers whose primary language is not English, and improves accuracy of translation into other languages where these words differ based on the gender of the noun that they refer to.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.12.** 

 Example Improvement This causes SSH to lose the recorded identities of the remote systems.

Option 1: This action causes SSH to lose the recorded identities of the remote systems.

Option 2: Consequently, SSH loses the recorded identities of the remote systems.

A site can use these to self-assign a private routable IP address space inside the organization. A site can use these unique local addresses to self-assign a private routable IP address space inside the organization.

[⁠]()

Verbosity

Avoid unnecessary words. Keep it succinct.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.13.** 

 Example Improvement The `fsck /dev/vdb1` command performs a file-system check on the XFS file system residing on the `/dev/vdb1` partition. The `fsck /dev/vdb1` command checks the XFS file system on the `/dev/vdb1` partition. Red Hat Insights provides different services for the administration and monitoring of the registered systems that can be used for troubleshooting and even remediation of the issues identified. Red Hat Insights services administer and monitor registered systems to troubleshoot and remediate issues. Perform the installation of the product. Install the product.

[⁠]()

Word Order

When two or more correct arrangements are possible, choose the order that creates the least ambiguity. Generally, this is the standard subject-verb-object sequence, with modifiers before or immediately following what they modify.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.14.** 

 Example Improvement To update the address lists might be your primary concern. Your primary concern might be to update the address lists.

## [⁠]()2.7. Easily Confused Words

This section identifies some easily confused words and how to choose the correct term for your situation.

[⁠]()

Affect and Effect

Each of these words can be used as a verb or a noun, but they are not always interchangeable.

[⁠]()affect

*n.* Refers to the emotional impact of an action. Unless you are writing a psychology article, this is unlikely to be the choice for you.

*v.* Means to have an influence on something, or to cause something to change.

[⁠]()effect

*n.* Refers to the result of some action. For example, "the team members discussed the effect of the new policy on their working conditions."

*v.* Means to produce a result, or to cause something to happen. For example, "the CEO claimed that the new policy would effect a positive economic outcome."

The use of "effect" as a verb is less common than the use of "affect", and there are usually alternatives that are clearer. For example, "the CEO claimed that the new policy would produce a positive economic outcome."

[⁠]()

Assure, Ensure, and Insure

These are relatively easy to get right, but here are some quick definitions.

[⁠]()assure

*v.* Suggests mental comfort. For example, "I assured my future father-in-law that I would eventually find a job."

[⁠]()ensure

*v.* Means to make sure of something, to be certain that something exists or some condition has been met.

[⁠]()insure

*v.* Relates to monetary insurance.

## [⁠]()2.8. Contractions and Abbreviations

Do not use contractions in Red Hat documents. For example, do not use "can't", "don't", "won't", and similar examples. Write out the words in full. Contractions are a mark of informal writing, and should be avoided when writing technical documentation or other more formal types of manuals. They can also cause problems for translation.

Take care also with abbreviations; replace "e.g." with "for example", and replace "i.e." with "that is", and so on.

## [⁠]()2.9. Punctuation

This section contains information on common punctuation topics. For more information, consult The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition.

### [⁠]()2.9.1. Colons and Semicolons

Current standards allow the use of a colon or semicolon in a range of different circumstances. Some of these are described in the following sections.

To Relate Clauses

The following sentences show a connection or shared theme between two clauses, or use the second clause to reiterate or amplify the idea in the first clause:

- They had been writing code all night: this factor could explain their bloodshot eyes.
- They had been writing code all night; this factor could explain their bloodshot eyes.
- I spend a lot of money on food; last month, I went out to eat 36 times.
- I spend a lot of money on food: last month, I went out to eat 36 times.

The phrase following a semicolon or colon should begin with a lowercase letter, unless it begins with a proper noun. In the case of a colon, use an uppercase letter if the phrase constitutes a complete sentence on its own.

Try to limit your use of colons and semicolons. Separate sentences with a period if possible.

To Introduce a Series

A colon is generally used before a series.

- The Triangle Area consists of three cities: Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.

Do not use a colon if the series is a complement or object of an element in the sentence.

- Before going on vacation, be sure to (1) set the alarm, (2) cancel the newspaper, and (3) ask a neighbor to collect your mail.

Use a semicolon to separate items in a series if the items contain commas.

- Every day I have coffee, toast, and fruit for breakfast; a salad for lunch; and a peanut butter sandwich, cookies, ice cream, and chocolate cake for dinner.

When a conjunctive adverb (such as *however, therefore, otherwise, namely, for example*, and so on) joins two independent clauses, use a semicolon before the conjunctive adverb and a comma after it.

- I think; therefore, I am.

[⁠]()

To Introduce a List, Command, Code Block, or Procedure

If a list, command, code block, or procedure immediately follows a single stem or introductory sentence, then end that sentence with a colon.

If, however, any sentences intervene between the introduction and the next item, then end both the introduction and any intervening sentences with a period instead.

In the following example, the related list immediately follows the stem, or introductory sentence, after "as follows". If that sentence instead ends with "the following", then ensure that a noun is used after those words.

- The steps for changing directories are as follows:
  
  1. Open a terminal.
  2. Type `cd Documents/Books`.

In the following example, a colon is used to introduce a bullet list:

- In the Properties dialog box, notice the following entries:
  
  - Connection name
  - Count
  - Confirm starting connection
  - Confirm stopping connection
  - Cost per unit

In the following example, a colon is used for a step that introduces a command:

- 2\. Use the `ansible-navigator run` command to run the `allfacts.yml` playbook:
  
  ```
  [student@workstation manage-facts]$ ansible-navigator run allfacts.yml
  PLAY [Gather and display facts for managed nodes] ****************************
  ```

In the following example, several sentences introduce a code example, and each one ends in a period:

- To configure SELinux persistently, use the `/etc/selinux/config` file. In the following default example, the configuration sets SELinux to `enforcing` mode. The comments list other valid values, such as the `permissive` and `disabled` modes.
  
  ```
  # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
  # SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
  # enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
  # permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
  # disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
  ...output omitted...
  ```

### [⁠]()2.9.2. Commas

[⁠]()

In Compound Sentences

Use a comma to join clauses in a compound sentence, unless the clauses are short and have a similar theme.

- I spent five hours working on this document, but I lost it when my computer crashed.
- Do you want to go the mall and the grocery store with me, or are you going to watch football instead?
- You play and I'll sing.

A comma can be omitted from a sentence with several clauses, but only when there is little chance that the sentence could be misread without it.

- We played football all afternoon and were completely exhausted but we still stayed up watching movies all night.

That sentence is acceptable, but adding a comma before "... but we still stayed up ..." would provide a pause and avoid the chance of having it read like a run-on sentence.

In a compound sentence that contains several short independent clauses, separate the clauses with commas and use a comma before the conjunction.

- You need to go to the grocery store for milk, drop off my dry cleaning, and pick up your little sister from soccer practice.

[⁠]()

With Conjunctive Adverbs

When using a conjunctive adverb (such as *however, therefore, otherwise, namely, for example*, and so on) in a sentence, set it off with commas.

- It rained all afternoon. As a result, we canceled our picnic.
- The grass, however, stayed dry under the trees.

[⁠]()

In Adverbial Clauses and Phrases

If a dependent clause is restrictive (omission affects the meaning of the main clause), do not set it off with commas. If it is nonrestrictive (omission does not affect the main clause), set it off with commas:

- I'll go to lunch with you if we can get pizza.
- I don't want to go out for pizza, because I had pizza yesterday.

If a dependent clause comes before the main clause, use a comma whether the clause is restrictive or not.

- If we get pizza, I'll go to lunch with you.
- When I heard the voice on the other end of the line, I was quite surprised.

[⁠]()

In Adjectival Clauses or Phrases

An adjectival clause that can be dropped without changing the meaning of the sentence is set off with commas.

- The application, which comes with excellent documentation, is used by many graphic artists.

An adjectival clause that cannot be dropped without changing the meaning of the sentence is not set off with commas:

- The plan that matters most to us will be easy to implement.

[⁠]()

With Coordinate Adjectives

Separate coordinate adjectives (two or more adjectives modifying the same noun) with commas.

- My dog is loyal, obedient, and affectionate.
- It was a long, boring meeting.

[⁠]()

With Series and Lists

Separate elements in a series of three or more with commas, including a comma before the conjunction if one is used.

- Today I am wearing socks, shoes, pants, and a shirt.

### [⁠]()2.9.3. Parentheses

Parentheses are similar to commas in that they set off information that further explains or enhances a statement. Information that is closely related to the statement should be set off with commas; information that is more incidental should be set off with parentheses.

- I tried to get to the elevator before the door shut, but I was too slow.
- Most of my favorite authors (Shakespeare, Dickens, Woolf) are dead.

Expressions beginning with *for example, that is* and so on can be set off with parentheses if they cause a major break in the sentence. If the break is minor, use commas.

- He interviewed the biggest stars of the day, namely, Madonna, Johnny Cash, and Jack Nicholson.
- Classic works of literature (such as Dickens, Shakespeare, the Brontes) lined the shelves.

If the contents of the parentheses include at least one complete sentence, the period goes inside the parentheses. If not, the period goes outside.

Do not use "(s)" in parentheses to denote a plural. If something can be singular or plural, make it plural.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.15.** 

 Example Improvement Choose the item(s). Choose the items.

### [⁠]()2.9.4. Slashes

Avoid use of a slash character to mean either of two options.

For example, instead of "enable/disable", use "enable or disable".

Instead of "A and/or B", use "A or B", or "A, or B, or both".

### [⁠]()2.9.5. Quotation Marks

When indicating the start or end of a direct quotation, use curly quotation marks. In all other contexts, such as when writing code samples, code syntax, hexadecimal numbers, or hypertext links, use straight quotation marks. Refer to [*Typographical Considerations*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=punctuation-quotation-marks#typographical-considerations) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

In technical documentation, place punctuation marks, including periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points, dashes, and semicolons inside the quotation marks if they are part of the quotation or part of a programming element that uses quotation marks; if not, place punctuation marks outside the quotation marks. If a sentence ends with a quotation, use only one punctuation mark to end the sentence, and place it inside the closing quotation mark if it is part of the quotation, or outside if it is not.

[⁠]()

**Example 2.3. Correct Examples of the Use of Punctuation with Quotation Marks**

- For bind mounts, add "bind" and set `fstype` to "none".
- ```
  Login successful.
  ...output omitted...
  Using project "default".
  ```
- The title of the web page is "OpenShift 3 Etherpad".
- In the program segment, ensure that the value is X'FF'.
- Julius Caesar said, "I came. I saw. I conquered."

### [⁠]()2.9.6. Apostrophes

Do not use an apostrophe to denote a plural.

To denote a possessive, use an apostrophe as follows:

Plural nouns not ending in *s* should add an *'s* (for example, the alumni's contribution).

Plural nouns ending in *s* only need an apostrophe (for example, the horses' food).

Singular common nouns ending in *s* should add an *'s* unless the next word begins with an *s* (for example, the witness's answer or the witness' story).

Singular proper names ending in *s* only need an apostrophe (for example, Dickens' novels).

For guidance on whether to use a possessive, refer to [Section 2.4, “Possessives”](#possessives).

Whether an apostrophe uses a straight character (the same as a straight single quotation mark) or a curly character is determined by considerations that include language, translation, and typography.

### [⁠]()2.9.7. Exclamation Points

Do not use at the end of sentences. An exclamation point can be used when referring to a command, such as the bang (!) command.

### [⁠]()2.9.8. Punctuation in Lists

For information about punctuation in lists, refer to [Section 5.1.1.2, “Punctuation in Lists”](#punc-in-lists).

### [⁠]()2.9.9. Punctuation in Tables

Use the following guidance for punctuation in tables:

If all cells in a table column are complete sentences, then end each cell with a period.

If all cells in a table column are sentence fragments, then do not use a period to end each cell.

If cells in a table column contain a mixture of complete sentences and sentence fragments, then first consider whether it would be appropriate to make them grammatically parallel (either all complete sentences or all sentence fragments). However, in some cases, such an approach might not work, where tables are complex and include a variety of content, such as lists of strings, variables, IP addresses, descriptions, or states (selected or cleared). In such cases, treat each cell as an individual entry, and either use or omit a closing period depending on whether that cell is a complete sentence.

Example of a complex table with punctuation:

[⁠]()

**Table 2.16.** 

 Field Value Question Default domain name Description This domain name is used to set the hostname of the node. Answer variable name `global_domain_name` Answer type text Required *(selected)* Minimum length 1 Maximum length 251 Default answer `lab.example.com`

### [⁠]()2.9.10. Referring to Punctuation Marks and Special Characters

To refer to a punctuation mark or special character, use its name alone if it is one of the following standard characters:

. , : ; ' ‘ ’ " “ ” ( ) \[ ] { } ! ?

For all other characters, use the character name followed by the symbol in parentheses. For special character names that include a noun such as "sign", "symbol", or "character", provide the character name, the noun that describes the symbol, and then the symbol in parentheses, for example "the greater-than symbol (&gt;)". For special character names that do not include such nouns, provide the character name and the symbol in parentheses, for example "a forward slash (/)". You can end a sentence with the symbol in parentheses.

Do not use the symbol on its own.

[⁠]()

**Example 2.4. Referring to Punctuation Marks**

Use a semicolon to separate two parts of a sentence that can each stand on its own.

The path contains the library qualifier in braces.

[⁠]()

**Example 2.5. Referring to Special Characters**

When a regular user starts a shell, the prompt includes an ending dollar sign ($).

Use the pipe character (|) to send the output of one program to the input of another program.

The hyphen after the greater than symbol (&gt;) indicates that a newline character (\\n) is not added to the end of the variable.

For more details, refer to [*Punctuation and Symbols*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=punctuation-symbols) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

### [⁠]()2.9.11. Names of Punctuation Marks and Special Characters

Use the names in the following table to refer to punctuation marks or special characters:

[⁠]()

**Table 2.17. Names of Punctuation Marks and Special Characters**

 Symbol Name &amp; Ampersand &lt; &gt; Angle brackets ' or ’ Apostrophe * Asterisk @ At sign \\ Backslash \` Backtick { } Braces \[ ] Brackets ^ Caret ✓ Checkmark : Colon , Comma $ Dollar sign " or “ ” Double quotation marks ... Ellipsis — Em dash – En dash = Equal sign ! Exclamation point / Forward slash &gt; Greater-than symbol - Hyphen or minus sign &lt; Less-than symbol # Number sign; use *hash* to refer to a hashtag in social media ( ) Parentheses % Percent sign . Period; dot (when not referring to punctuation) | Pipe character + Plus sign ? Question mark ; Semicolon ' or ‘ ’ Single quotation marks ~ Tilde _ Underscore

## [⁠]()2.10. Hyphenation

No hard and fast rules exist for hyphenation. In general, do not hyphenate unless required for clarity, or your other references declare that hyphens are required. The following is general guidance; if you are unsure about whether to hyphenate, ask your peers. Refer to [*Hyphens*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=punctuation-hyphens) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

[⁠]()

Hyphenate for Clarity

Hyphenate when needed for clarity. Words that begin with prefixes are usually not hyphenated. Prefixes can include "multi", "non", "sub", "co", "semi", "pre", "re", and so on. The same applies to suffixes; for example, "less" as a suffix does not require hyphenation.

**Note**

Always use a hyphen if clarity would suffer otherwise. For example, "He recovered his health" versus "He re-covered the leaky roof." [⁠]()[\[1\]](#ftn.id2668)

[⁠]()

Hyphenate Complex Adjectives

Hyphenate complex adjectives (compound modifiers). This is when two adjectives work together to modify an object. The hyphen is used when the first adjective modifies the second adjective. For example, cloud-based solutions, right-side paralysis, system-wide menu.

**Note**

Do not hyphenate "open source", even when used as a complex adjective.

Do not hyphenate a compound that includes an adverb that ends in *-ly*, whether it comes before or after the noun, because it is never ambiguous. This is described in Chicago Manual of Style 7.82. For example, "Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a production-ready, commercially supported Linux distribution."

[⁠]()

Hyphenate Consecutive Vowel Sounds

Hyphenate words where the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. For example, semi-independent, pre-emptive.

**Note**

Exceptions to this rule include *cooperate* and *coordinate.*

[⁠]()

Hyphenate Mixed Capitalization

Hyphenate when the word that follows a prefix is capitalized. For example, un-American, non-British.

[⁠]()

Hyphenate Double Prefixes

Hyphenate when the word has double prefixes. For example, sub-subparagraph, re-sublet.

## [⁠]()2.11. Pronouns and Gender References

Do not use gender-specific pronouns in documentation, except to refer to a specific named user, such as in a case study. It is easier to read a sentence that uses "they" and "their" rather than "he/she" and "his/hers". It is acceptable to use "they" to refer to one person, with a plural verb.

Usually, when giving instructions, use the imperative mood or use "you". In more general explanations, you can use "users" or "new users". Do not use "one" in place of "you" when writing technical documentation, because it is too formal. Do not use "it" to refer to a person.

Avoid first person "I, we, our". Use second person "you" whenever possible.

If referring to what Red Hat does, use "Red Hat" followed by a singular verb.

[⁠]()

**Table 2.18.** 

 Example Improvement An engineer must be trained on the equipment that he services. Engineers must be trained on the equipment that they service. In the web console, we can restart or shut down the system. In the web console, you can restart or shut down the system. We recommend that you generate a service account for each microservice in your project. Red Hat recommends that you generate a service account for each microservice in your project.

## [⁠]()2.12. Tense

Avoid future tense (or using the term "will") whenever possible. For example, future tense ("The window will open ...") does not read as well as the present tense ("The window opens ..."). Remember, the users you are writing for most often refer to the documentation while they are using the system, not after or in advance of using the system.

Use simple present tense as much as possible. It avoids problems with consequences and time-related communications, and is the easiest tense for translation.

## [⁠]()3.1. Overall Publication Design

This section describes a general approach to the overall layout and design of technical documentation. This design was developed specifically for technical documentation and might not suit content produced by other groups.

This section covers the following topics:

- Titles and subtitles
- Prefaces
- Abstracts
- Introductions
- Placement of headings
- Unused heading titles

### [⁠]()3.1.1. Titles and Subtitles

The title should be a combination of the complete product name, its version, and the name of the publication. For example, "Red Hat Satellite 6.12 Installation Guide", or "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Deployment Guide".

The subtitle should be a single, succinct phrase that describes the intent of the publication; an abstract of the abstract. For example, "Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for All Architectures".

### [⁠]()3.1.2. Prefaces

The brands that form part of Publican ([https://fedorahosted.org/publican/](https://fedorahosted.org/publican/)) contain a preface as part of the common content. Whether your publication is for external Red Hat customers, JBoss customers, internal customers, or whomever, the brand you choose should provide a suitable preface. Try to use the standard preface to help maintain consistency, reduce overhead and maintenance, and also to reduce translation costs. If you feel that the preface fails to meet your needs, consider whether or not you are using the correct brand, or if the brand itself requires an update.

### [⁠]()3.1.3. Abstracts

Abstracts for Red Hat technical documentation typically fall under the heading of a "descriptive abstract". From Wikipedia, "The descriptive abstract, also known as the limited abstract or the indicative abstract, provides a description of what the paper covers without delving into its substance. A descriptive abstract is akin to a table of contents in paragraph form." [⁠]()[\[2\]](#ftn.id2752)

A suitable abstract covers the high-level topics of the publication, and is probably a good place to mention the audience. It should cover the following basics:

- What: What is the purpose of the publication or document? A brief summary, for example, "The Red Hat Satellite 5.6 API Guide is a full reference for Satellite's XMRPC API."
- How: How does the publication convey its content? That is, is it task-based? Example-driven? A reference guide? For example, "The guide explains each API method and demonstrates examples of data models for input and output."
- Why (and possibly Who): A basic rationale for why this publication exists, and its audience (and elaborate on the target audience inside the publication). For example, "This publication provides a basis for administrators and developers to write custom scripts and to integrate Red Hat Satellite with third-party applications."

Drawing these basics together might produce the following example abstract:

"The Red Hat Satellite 5.6 API Guide is a full reference for Satellite's XMRPC API. The guide explains each API method and demonstrates examples of data models for input and output. This publication provides a basis for administrators and developers to write custom scripts and to integrate Red Hat Satellite with third-party applications."

Update or modify each component according to the type of publication that you are writing.

### [⁠]()3.1.4. Introductions

The term "introduction" on its own is sufficiently vague, and raises enough questions in translation and with translation memory tools, that Red Hat technical documentation does not use this term on its own. Instead, use the phrase "Introduction to &lt;product\_name&gt;" near the beginning of the publication to introduce the reader to the product. Do not use "Introduction" to introduce the publication; that is the task of the Abstract. A further benefit of this usage is that the same introduction can be used across various books to introduce the same product.

### [⁠]()3.1.5. Placement of Headings

Do not include two consecutive headings without intervening text. Each heading must be followed by one or more paragraphs of text. If it is difficult to provide meaningful intervening text, then consider whether one of the headings is unnecessary.

### [⁠]()3.1.6. Unused Heading Titles

This section lists various heading titles that might be used in Red Hat technical documentation, but that should be avoided except in specific circumstances.

[⁠]()

Overview

Use "Overview" in a title only sparingly, and do not use "Overview" as a title on its own. No justification was found for using it as a title; anywhere that it might be considered is already covered by either better or more common titles.

[⁠]()

About

Do not use "about" or "about &lt;topic&gt;" as a title. The same reasoning applies here as to "overview".

[⁠]()

Chapter and Section Introductions

Do not create separate introductions for chapters and sections. Use any material that would constitute an introductory section to form body text following the chapter or section title.

## [⁠]()3.2. Heading Styles

This section covers various aspects of heading styles and design. If your company or organization has specific requirements in this regard, follow those requirements first.

[⁠]()

Capitalization

The standard for technical documentation is title case for all headings and titles. Table titles and procedure titles fall into this category; standard title case capitalization rules apply.

Use title case also when referring to the titles of other publications, even if the title on the publication itself uses different casing.

The currently accepted reference for determining title case is at [https://titlecase.com/titlecase](https://titlecase.com/titlecase).

Use sentence case for figure captions, legends, diagram labels, and table column headers. They are not classified as titles.

Punctuation

Be frugal with punctuation. Avoid semicolons, colons, dashes, and similar punctuation unless part of the actual subject, or a proper name. Do not use terminating periods.

[⁠]()

Writing Effective Titles

Use a title that represents the content.

Typically, the "ing" form of a verb is a good way to title larger chunks of content such as chapters and sections, for example "Creating Branches". Choose a verb that refers to specific actions that users take, such as "Configuring", "Creating", "Installing", and "Merging".

Activities and subtasks that the user should perform can alternatively use an imperative verb for clarity. Imperative verbs are prescriptive, such as "Create" or "Delete". Example: "Assess the Health of an OpenShift Cluster".

In some cases, a verb might not be appropriate because the content is purely informational. Instead of using a vague verb like "Understanding", "Describing", "Introducing", or "Exploring", either use a more specific verb, or use a noun phrase instead of a verb. A noun phrase is descriptive and omits a verb, for example "OpenShift Operators" or "The OpenShift Web Console."

Avoid a title that consists of only one word.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.1.** 

 Example Improvement Understanding OpenShift Users and Groups OpenShift Users and Groups Introducing Cluster Updates Cluster Updates MetalLB The MetalLB Component

In training content, avoid using a verb such as "Discussing" or "Demonstrating" in objectives for students. Such verbs might refer instead to what the instructor or the course content covers, or to a student group activity in class.

**Important**

Gerunds should be avoided elsewhere. Refer to [Section 2.6, “Sentence Structure”](#sentence-structure).

File Names, Commands, and Related Terms

When creating chapter and section titles, do not include file, command, or similar names, and generally do not include markup elements. Instead, focus on the task at hand and introduce the required file and command names in the text. Including such objects in titles is generally considered poor technical writing practice. Depending on how your documentation is built and delivered, including these object types can result in unpredictable results and can even cause failed builds.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.2.** 

 Example Improvement Custom Domains and cert-manager Operators with ROSA Custom Domains and Certificate Management Operators with ROSA

## [⁠]()3.3. Documenting Fonts

The preferred way to refer to each type of PostScript font is "PostScript Type x", substituting "x" with either 1, 2, or 3, if the problem is specific to a particular type.

## [⁠]()3.4. Documenting the User Interface

For initial guidance in all cases, refer to [*UI Elements*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=elements-ui) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** . The following sections highlight exceptions or cases that might otherwise cause confusion.

When writing about items in a user interface (UI), match the capitalization and spelling of those items from the interface. However, if the interface contains a spelling error, then correct the spelling in your writing, and get the interface corrected if possible. Depending on the context, an option might be to write around an incorrectly spelled interface item rather than naming it specifically.

### [⁠]()3.4.1. User Interface Elements and Punctuation

When describing UI elements, do not include punctuation that appears on those elements, unless omission of that punctuation might lead to confusion.

For example, for a button labeled **Save As...**, do not include the ellipsis in the documentation.

Avoid including the element type in instructions. For example, rather than "Click the **Save** button", write "Click **Save**".

In some cases it is preferred practice to include the object type for the sake of clarity. Consider the following example:

[⁠]()

**Example 3.1. Preferred Style for Documenting Icons**

Click the **Upload** ( **![](images/reload.png)** ) icon to upload the files to the server.

For more information, refer to [*UI Elements*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=elements-ui) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

#### [⁠]()3.4.1.1. Moving Through Multiple UI Options

Use "go to" when moving through multiple UI options because it covers all cases where you might have to click, point to, press, select, or otherwise make a series of selections to start an action.

For example, "From the OpenShift web console, go to Monitoring → Metrics and enter the following metrics as queries."

### [⁠]()3.4.2. Figures, Illustrations, and Screenshots

For general advice about using figures, illustrations, and screenshots, refer to [*Figures*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=format-figures) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

The following specific conventions apply to using captions and callouts with figures in Red Hat technical documentation, and are generally recommended.

- If the image is well documented and described in the surrounding text, no caption or callouts are required.
- If the image is not fully described in the surrounding text, use a caption or legend to complete the information for the reader.
- If the image is complex and requires detailed explanation, consider using callouts to describe each of the relevant parts.

**Note**

Do not use callouts and captions on the same figure.

### [⁠]()3.4.3. Starting Applications from the Desktop

This section describes how to start applications from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based distribution.

RHEL 8 uses the following approach to starting applications from the desktop. To maintain consistency and to make translation easier, Red Hat documentation assumes the use of GNOME Classic, the default user interface, and prefers a consistent approach to instructing customers how to start applications.

The preferred approach is to use the **Super** key to enter the Activities Overview, to enter the name of the required application, and to press **Enter**. The **Super** key appears in various guises, depending on the keyboard and other hardware, but often as either the Windows or Command key, and typically to the left of the **Spacebar**. For example:

[⁠]()

**Example 3.2. Preferred Approach to Starting Applications from the Desktop**

To start gedit, press the **Super** key to enter the Activities Overview, type `gedit`, and then press **Enter**.

### [⁠]()3.4.4. Documenting Command Terminology and Syntax

Sufficient variation exists in the terminology that is used to describe commands, options, arguments, and so on that only general advice is provided here.

When referring to the command line as specified by Bash and POSIX, follow the terminology that the software uses. Never use "flag" when referring to command-line options in POSIX, even though Microsoft often uses the term "flag" when referring to single-character options in Microsoft Windows.

The following extract from `info libc` is of particular interest here:

> "POSIX recommends these conventions for command line arguments. \[...] Arguments are options if they begin with a hyphen delimiter ('-'). Multiple options may follow a hyphen delimiter in a single token if the options do not take arguments. Thus, '-abc' is equivalent to '-a -b -c'. \[...] Certain options require an argument. For example, the '-o' option of the 'ld' command requires an argument—an output file name". and so on.
> 
> Refer to `info libc argument syntax` for the full discussion.

For further guidance, refer to `info bash`, and to [*Technical Elements*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=technical-elements) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

The following examples are intended to highlight correct usage.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.3. Cloning a Git Repository**

```
$ git clone [username@]hostname:/repository_filename [directory]
```

In [Example 3.3, “Cloning a Git Repository”](#exam-documenting-command-syntax), the entire command consists of the following components:

[⁠]()The prompt (`$`)

Indicates that a normal user can run the command, as compared to the `root` user, which would be indicated by the number sign (`#`).

[⁠]()The command (`git clone`)

The actual command to run, without any optional or replaceable values. It must be typed as-is.

[⁠]()Source options *\[username@]hostname:/repository\_filename*)

The optional username, indicated by brackets, \[], followed by the hostname and path to the repository. All aspects of this component must be replaced with valid values.

[⁠]()Target options *\[directory]*

The optional directory into which the repository is cloned. It must be replaced with a valid value, or be omitted.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.4. Securely Copying a File Between Hosts**

```
$ scp filename [username@]hostname:/directory
```

In [Example 3.4, “Securely Copying a File Between Hosts”](#exam-secure-copy), the entire command consists of the following components:

[⁠]()The command prompt (`$`)

[⁠]()The command (`scp`)

[⁠]()Source options (*filename*)

The file name to copy. It must be replaced with a valid value.

Target options (*\[username@]hostname:/directory*)

The optional username, indicated by brackets, \[], followed by the hostname and path to the target directory. All aspects of this component must be replaced with valid values.

**Warning**

Avoid using the `--force (-f)` and `--assumeyes (-y)` options on most commands, especially when logged in as the `root` user. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as removing files or directories by mistake or installing packages or other software that might not suit your system. Refer to the following examples:

```
[root@serverc pam.d]# rm -f system-auth password-auth
[root@serverc ~]# yum install -y new-package
```

In these examples, omit the `-f` and `-y` options, respectively.

In some cases, such as in Ansible Playbooks or other automation scripts, it might be necessary to use these options.

#### [⁠]()3.4.4.1. Documenting Multiple or Long Commands

**Note**

The following guidance differs from previous guidance on the subject.

Sometimes you need to show how to use long commands that extend over two or more lines, or that include several commands in a single example. If the commands are relatively short and straightforward, then include the commands on consecutive lines.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.5. Documenting Multiple Commands**

```
$ cd Documents
$ vi myFile.txt
```

If the commands are long, complex, or wrap over multiple lines, then use the following design:

- Use line continuation characters without the associated PS2 prompts.
- On Linux and macOS operating systems, use the Linux shell continuation character (\\).
- On Windows operating systems, use the backtick character (\`).
- For content that is potentially used in multiple operating systems, use the Linux shell continuation character, and include an explanatory sentence before the command.

Do not use manual line indentation for the second and subsequent lines of commands. For some output formats, no control is possible over where lines would break, and any indentation might appear as extra spaces in inelegant places.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.6. Long Command Example**

If the `memory` machine pool does not exist, then create it.

On a Microsoft Windows system, replace the line continuation character (\\) in the following long command with the backtick character (\`), which is the line continuation character in PowerShell.

```
$  aws iam create-policy --policy-name RosaCloudWatch \  
  --policy-document file://policy.json --query Policy.Arn --output text 
arn:aws:iam::452954386616:policy/RosaCloudWatch
```

The ARN in the preceding output is different on your system.

#### [⁠]()3.4.4.2. Omitting Part of Output

For the sake of brevity, do not show all output to the user in all cases, but only those parts of any output that are relevant to the context that is described. Where output is not included, place a marker to show that information is purposely excluded. When shortening the output, use a consistent notation. For omitting entire horizontal lines of output, Red Hat uses the *...output omitted...* notation, starting and ending with an ellipsis, and highlighted in italics.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.7. Notation for Omitting Horizontal Output**

```
[student@workstation image]$ podman build --layers=false -t nexus .
STEP 1: FROM ubi8/ubi:8.3
Getting image source signatures
...output omitted...
STEP 14: COMMIT ...output omitted... localhost/nexus:latest
```

For omitting vertical columns of output, omitting partial lines of output, or to shorten long strings in output, Red Hat uses the ellipsis notation (...).

[⁠]()

**Example 3.8. Notation for Omitting Vertical Output**

```
[user@host ~]$  oc get csv 
NAME                                    DISPLAY                        ...
barbican-operator.v1.0.0                Barbican Operator              ...
cinder-operator.v1.0.0                  Cinder Operator                ...
designate-operator.v1.0.0               Designate Operator             ...
glance-operator.v1.0.0                  Glance Operator                ...
heat-operator.v1.0.0                    Heat Operator                  ...
horizon-operator.v1.0.0                 Horizon Operator               ...
...output omitted...
```

#### [⁠]()3.4.4.3. Referring to Replaceable Paths

To refer to a path that users need to replace with something that is specific to their system, use the appropriate markup for your content, the correct syntax for the system and object in question, and an indicative name. Use a leading slash if the absolute path is required.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.9. Referring to Replaceable Paths on Linux Systems**

"Mount the ISO file in */path/to/iso/file*."

Remember to use the appropriate syntax for the system that you are documenting or describing.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.10. Referring to Replaceable Paths on Microsoft Windows Systems**

"Mount the ISO file in *C:\\path\\to\\iso\\file*."

If you are referring to a different object class or type with different delimiters, use the appropriate delimiters. For example:

A PATH variable for Bash might appear as */usr/bin:/usr/local/bin*.

A package path in Lua might appear as *local.share.lua*.

### [⁠]()3.4.5. Using Escalated Privileges Correctly

The term *escalated privileges* refers to changing to a user whose privileges allow operations that a normal user cannot access. It also refers to temporarily changing the privileges of the current user to perfom those operations without changing user accounts.

**Note**

This section is aimed primarily at Red Hat Training course material, but the principles and guidelines apply equally in any environment.

**Classroom Exceptions**

Although security is important, it is more important that classroom security does not unnecessarily distract from the immediate topic that is being taught.

#### [⁠]()3.4.5.1. General Recommendations

The following are *recommendations*, not rules. As in most matters, consistency is important. Do not swap between different approaches without reason. Choose which approach works best for your situation and use it consistently.

- In all cases, use the minimum required privilege level to achieve the task.
- Use a consistent approach when giving instructions to change users. For example: "Connect to the cluster node and become the `root` user."
  
  Variations such as "become `root`" or similar are strongly discouraged.
- Use `sudo` and `sudo -i` and set it up to work throughout all relevant systems. Do not use `su -` without good cause.
- When a scattered minority of privileged commands occur in a mostly unprivileged exercise, use `sudo` on a per-command basis.
- When the exercise is majority privileged, or has many privileged commands, use `sudo -i`, either at the beginning of the exercise, or at an appropriate step where the privileged commands begin.
- In the narrative, do not show the use of `su` or `sudo`, but always show privileged commands with the correct prompt. Refer to [Example 3.3, “Cloning a Git Repository”](#exam-documenting-command-syntax) for information about command prompts.

**Note**

Some courses are specifically designed to teach `sudo` and its variations, the use of the related files, such as `/etc/sudoers`, and so on. For these courses, use the required variation for the topic that is being taught.

#### [⁠]()3.4.5.2. Ansible Courses

- Ansible courses typically use a `devops` user with passwordless sudo access (`devops ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`) on managed nodes to enable the use of `become` without a `become` password as `root` to do anything.
- As much as possible, configure the default setting for `become` to `false`. If a single task needs privileges, then set `become: true` on that task.
- If most tasks in a play require escalated privileges, then set the entire play to `become: true` and selectively set individual tasks that do not need escalated privileges to `become: false`.

### [⁠]()3.4.6. Describing How to View and Edit Files

To describe how to view and edit files, such as configuration files, scripts, and so on, do not include editor names as part of the guidance, unless the topic is about a specific editor, or is otherwise necessary to achieve a wanted result.

For example, do not refer to `cat` or `vi` if you need to tell readers to "view the `my-script` file". If you need to tell readers to edit a file and add or remove content, write "Edit the `my-script` file and add the following content:" and then include the required content in a code block and highlight the text to change. Include some surrounding text in the file for context. Do not use line numbers as a reference point because they can change.

If the file to edit is empty or does not exist, do not highlight any content to add.

You can also use `here` documents to describe how to create a file with required content. For more information about `here` documents, refer to [https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) The syntax of `here` documents varies by system, shell, language, and so on. The following example creates the `my-script` file in the current directory, with the example content.

```
$ cat << EOF > my-script
> # The first line of text
> # The second line
> # Start adding variables after this line
> EOF
```

In some cases, it is necessary to indicate which tool to use to view a file, especially for log files and other long files. In these cases, suggest a viewer based on the operating system or environment in which you are working, such as `tail`, `head`, `less`, or `journalctl`.

### [⁠]()3.4.7. Using Host and Usernames Correctly

Many examples in Red Hat documentation require the use of usernames, hostnames, IP addresses, and similar information. To reduce security risks, to minimize translation overhead, and to maintain consistency, Red Hat recommends the following approach:

**Note**

All names are lowercase. Do not use white space in any part of the name.

- Use [RFC 2606](http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2606) to find suitable domain names. For documentation and example purposes, it is typically `example.com`, `example.net`, `example.org`, and `example.edu`.
  
  **Important**
  
  Do not use valid, public IP addresses in any examples.
- As much as possible, use `user`, `username`, `root`, `admin`, or similar names to identify classes of users.
  
  Use these generic names when you refer to users outside a case study. It helps students to identify which part of a command to replace, by establishing a consistent format for names of users and system items. For example:
  
  ```
  [root@fedora ~]# setfacl -m u:user1:rw /project/file1
  ```
  
  The following list provides further options:
  
  - `operator1` to `operator9`
  - `developer1` to `developer9`
  - `architect1` to `architect9`

#### [⁠]()3.4.7.1. Using Extended User and Group Names

Sometimes, the recommended list of user and group names is too restrictive for the scope of a publication or article. In such cases, the following extended model is acceptable.

[⁠]()

Using Realistic Usernames

When you are writing a detailed case study, such as training exercises, reviews, and similar material, use realistic names. These names should not be real people. In other words, do not use the name of an employee, a well-known person, or your neighbor.

For example, you are the system administrator at Global Banking and you are asked to set up permissions to the accounting directory for the following users: Huong Sabo, Jolene Paluch, Abby Quincy, Francis Ritcher, and Jaya Lamont. Huong is a department manager and needs read access to the accounting directory. Jolene is the lead accountant and needs both read and write access.

[⁠]()

Choosing a Realistic Name

Consider the following points when choosing a realistic name:

- In examples or scenarios, you can use a person's name and then use a gender-specific pronoun to refer to that name. Vary the use of proper names in documentation. Use names that represent various ethnic backgrounds, genders, and locations.
- Include a diverse set of names in your examples to reflect the diversity of the real world. For example, use gender-inclusive and culturally diverse names that suggest various backgrounds in examples to avoid implying that only certain groups have specific skills.
- Do not use copyrighted fictional characters in examples, and do not use real people.
- When choosing names, also consider how those names might appear in email addresses, usernames, and similar contexts. Avoid name combinations or abbreviations that result in unintended meanings, such as slang. An example that works well might be "John Smith", with an email address of `jsmith@example.com`. However, for the name "Brian Strong", a corresponding email address of `bstrong@example.com` might not work so well (when read out, it sounds like "be strong"). Consider also any implications for names in different languages.

Sourcing Realistic Names

You can use any of the following name generators to create realistic names for users:

- [http://listofrandomnames.com/](http://listofrandomnames.com/)
- [http://www.behindthename.com/random/](http://www.behindthename.com/random/)
- [http://random-name-generator.info/](http://random-name-generator.info/)

[⁠]()

Group Names

Use any lowercase name that is a logical extension of the accepted usernames, without the numerical suffix. For example, `architects`, `developers`, `operators`.

### [⁠]()3.4.8. Referring to Object Names

When using object names, write a sentence so that it is complete without the object name.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.3.** 

 Example Improvement Find the current default `StorageClass`.

Either: Find the current default storage class.

Or: Find the current default `StorageClass` value.

Avoid starting or ending a sentence with an object name.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.4.** 

 Example Improvement `Umount /mnt/save`. Unmount the `/mnt/save` directory. Modify the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to use this `nameserver`. Modify the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to use this name server.

In most cases, place an object name before the noun that it modifies rather than after the noun.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.5.** 

 Example Improvement Enable the default module stream for the module `python36` and install all packages from that stream. Enable the default module stream for the `python36` module and install all packages from that stream.

However, in some cases, the sentence might be easier to understand if the noun appears first, or if additional language separates the object name from the noun. For example, if the noun refers to a password, a value, or a status, then consider stating the noun first, or including explanatory language between the object name and the noun, or doing both. In other cases, a noun might be omitted.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.6.** 

 Example Improvement Log in as the `admin` user with the `redhat` password. Log in as the `admin` user with `redhat` as the password. Define the `backup_tmp` variable with the `/tmp` value in the `defaults/main.yml` file. Define the `backup_tmp` variable with a value of `/tmp` in the `defaults/main.yml` file. The `is:clear` key is set to the `false` value. The `is:clear` key is set to `false`.

### [⁠]()3.4.9. Naming of Object Classes

When naming an object, consider the impact of its name when writing about the object. Avoid duplication, alliteration, or long names. In cases where including the class in an object name helps to provide clarity, avoid including the object's class in the last part of its name. This approach avoids repetition when writing about the object where the noun that follows the object name indicates its class.

[⁠]()

**Table 3.7.** 

 Example Improvement The user that you use to log in is the `remote-user` user. Log in as the `user-remote` user. Go to the `local-project` project. Go to the `proj-local` project. Use the `base-layer` layer of the container. Use the `base-image` layer of the container. Create the instance in the `prod-environment` environment. Create the instance in the `prod` environment. Use the `oc process --parameters` command to view the parameter of the `roster-template` template. Use the `oc process --parameters` command to view the parameter of the `roster` template. Create the `namesList` variable in the `my-file` file as part of the `managedCluster` cluster. Create the `namesList` variable in the `file-test` file as part of the `cluster-managed` cluster. Verify that the `famous-quotes-pvc` PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) is successfully created. Verify that the `famous-quotes` PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) is successfully created.

## [⁠]()3.5. Documenting Currencies

Use local currency symbols wherever possible. If symbol clash occurs (USD versus AUD, for example), disambiguate with the 2-character country code. For example, US$, AU$.

**Important**

Do not provide currency conversions.

## [⁠]()3.6. Abbreviations, Acronyms, Initialisms, and Special Characters

This section defines abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms, and special characters.

[⁠]()

Abbreviations

An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. For example, Pty. and Inc. are abbreviations for "proprietary" and "incorporated", respectively. Read them as the word for which they are an abbreviation.

[⁠]()

Acronyms

An acronym is a word that is formed from the initial letters of a name, such as ROM for *R*ead-*O*nly *M*emory, or by combining initial letters or part of a series of words, such as LILO for *LI*nux *LO*ader. COBOL is the acronym for Common Business-oriented Language, and POP is the acronym for Post Office Protocol.

[⁠]()

Initialisms

An initialism is an abbreviation that consists of the first letters of words in a phrase, syllables, or some combination thereof. Each character is pronounced separately. For example, FTP is an initialism for File Transfer Protocol.

[⁠]()

Special Characters

For the purposes of this guide, special characters refer to those characters that are listed in [Section 2.9.11, “Names of Punctuation Marks and Special Characters”](#punc-names). This section addresses how to use special characters as part of a file or directory name, such as "the `.bashrc` file" and "the `_build/` directory".

### [⁠]()3.6.1. Using Abbreviations, Acronyms, Initialisms, and Special Characters Correctly

This section describes how to use abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms, and special characters correctly in Red Hat documentation.

[⁠]()

First Mentions

Spell out most acronyms and initialisms before using them in text, such as "The Embedded DevKit (EDK) ...". Unless required for the audience or the topic, do not spell out well-known initialisms, such as HTML.

[⁠]()

Capitalization

Unless the acronym or initialism stands for a proper noun, use sentence case for the spelled out version: for example, "central processing unit (CPU)". Not all acronyms are capitalized (for example, "spool"); refer to [*Capitalization*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=grammar-capitalization) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** or to another suitable reference if you are unsure.

[⁠]()

Articles

When deciding which articles to use, consider pronunciation. For example, use "an RTS (real-time strategy)", because RTS is an initialism and you pronounce the first character as an "R" (är). Conversely, use "a RAM upgrade", because RAM is an acronym and you pronounce it as a word (răm).

[⁠]()

Plurals

To form the plural of an acronym, add a trailing, lowercase "s" or "es" without an apostrophe, for example, ROMs, PINs, BIOSes.

[⁠]()

Possessives

Do not use possessives with abbreviations. For examples and more information, refer to [Section 2.4, “Possessives”](#possessives).

[⁠]()

Special Characters

Consider pronunciation when referring to file or directory names that begin with special characters, and use the correct indefinite article.

If a file or directory name begins with a special character, such as an underscore, then you need to pronounce that character.

For example, using "an `_build/` directory" is correct, because you pronounce "an underscore build directory".

Using "a `-compile/` directory" is correct, because you pronounce "a dash compile directory".

## [⁠]()3.7. Using Company, Product, and Brand Names Correctly

Various restrictions apply to using company, product, and brand names in Red Hat documentation. Refer to internal sources for further conditions that might apply to your own products.

**Note**

In the following sections, "first use" refers to the first use of a name in body text. Titles, banners, and similar objects are not classified as "first use".

Restrictions apply to abbreviating Red Hat product or solution names in public-facing documents. Always use the full name on first use. For some products, for example Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can omit "Red Hat" after the first use.

Further restrictions apply to using acronyms and initialisms. In this same example, and only in technical documentation, "RHOCP" is acceptable after the first use of the full product name.

Do not include "Inc." when referring to Red Hat except in legal documents.

Do not use articles in front of product names. For example, do not write "the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform was ...".

**Note**

In this case, "Platform" is part of the product name. In other cases, words like "platform", "manager", and so on might not be part of the product name, in which case an article is acceptable, if not necessary.

Do not use possessives to refer to product names. For examples and more information, refer to [Section 2.4, “Possessives”](#possessives).

Do not hyphenate or break a product name across lines.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.11. Incorrect Example of Line Breaking**

For advanced management capabilities with Red  
Hat Satellite and cloud management services, use the Red  
Hat Enterprise Linux Smart Management Add  
\-On.

## [⁠]()3.8. Using Non-breaking Spaces

**Important**

The following guidance about using non-breaking spaces applies only to the Red Hat company name and to Red Hat products. Do not use non-breaking spaces with other companies' product names.

To keep text together on the same line, use a non-breaking space in the following situations:

- In the company name, between "Red" and "Hat".
- In a product name, between the last word and a version number.
- Between a numeral and a unit of measurement.

Examples (for AsciiDoc):

- Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux{nbsp}8
- Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform{nbsp}4.9
- The `crashkernel=auto` setting requires at least 1{nbsp}GB of memory.

If you are working with images or other objects where space is especially tight, this rule is more flexible, but "Red Hat" should never be broken over two lines.

Non-breaking spaces are not needed elsewhere in a product name and might cause undesirable line-breaking behavior. In particular, do not use non-breaking spaces between extended components of Red Hat product names. For example, "Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform" does not require a non-breaking space between any of the words after "Red Hat".

## [⁠]()3.9. Using Version Numbers Correctly

The preferred format for product names includes only the major version number. For example:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
- JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 3

When writing about a product line, product release, or product family, use major version numbers. It includes all the releases (past, present, and future) of that major version.

Only use minor version numbers when you are referring to a specific minor release, or to a feature that is specific to that minor release. For example:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 was released on October 12, 2010.
- &lt;Application name&gt; was first included in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 3.2.

Major changes usually take place in major version releases, and are carried through any minor updates to that release. If you are referring to a major change, or to the first appearance of a new technology, it is therefore most accurate to refer to the major release.

Avoid using the "dot-oh" release number. For example, do not use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0. Use instead Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

**Important**

This rule applies only to Red Hat products. Refer to other companies' products and use their version numbers as they use them.

## [⁠]()3.10. Using Admonitions

To call attention to a statement, use an admonition. Red Hat technical documentation currently uses `Note`, `Important`, and `Warning` admonitions.

Depending on the tools and workflow, admonitions might automatically include a suitable title according to the type of admonition. Do not use a phrase or anything else for the title. Keep the following considerations in mind if using admonitions:

- Keep statements brief and to the point.
- Use admonitions sparingly so that they do not lose their effectiveness.
- Use a `Note` admonition to bring extra information to the user's attention.
- Use an `Important` admonition to show the user a piece of information that should not be overlooked. This information might not change anything that the user is doing, but it should show the user that this piece of information could be vital.
- Use a `Warning` admonition to alert the reader to potential changes, such as files being removed, and not to perform the operation unless fully aware of the consequences.

## [⁠]()3.11. Making Recommendations

When making a recommendation, the preferred verbiage is "Red Hat recommends ..." instead of the common but indirect "It is recommended ...". Recommendations can include best practices, recommended practices, and product-specific suggestions. Refer to [Section 4.1, “Avoiding Misleading or Confusing Language”](#avoiding-confusing-language) for information on using the terms "best practices" and "recommended practices" in Red Hat documentation.

[⁠]()

**Example 3.12.  (incorrect)**

"Although the attack surface is reduced to the same-project traffic, it is recommended to create multiple service accounts within a project."

"It is recommended to generate a service account for each microservice in your project."

[⁠]()

**Example 3.13.  (correct)**

"Although the attack surface is reduced to the same-project traffic, Red Hat recommends creating multiple service accounts within a project."

"Red Hat recommends that you generate a service account for each microservice in your project."

## [⁠]()3.12. Citing Other Works

[⁠]()

Referencing Other Publications

When referencing another publication, either internal or external to Red Hat, use the following format:

```

Publication Title by First name Surname; Publisher.
```

For example, *Maximum RPM* by Edward Bailey; Red Hat Press.

[⁠]()

Referencing Other Internet Sites

When referencing another internet site, use the following guidelines:

- Do not link words within the body text. That is, do not use structures such as "Go [here](somewhere.com) for more information", where "here" is a link.
- Short URLs, such as [http://partner.redhat.com](http://partner.redhat.com), are OK to use in body text at your discretion.
- If the URL is long or complex, then create a link by using the title of the destination as a label, and put the URL in a footnote. For example: Refer to the [*Classification of Species*](https://www.britannica.com/animal/mammal/Classification) [⁠]()[\[3\]](#ftn.id3564) page for more information.

Red Hat produces documentation for a global audience, and in many cases this documentation is translated into many languages. To reach the widest possible audience, and to make the task of translation as straightforward as possible, avoid slang and other culture-specific terminology. This chapter attempts to identify commonly used slang terms and phraseology, and to provide alternatives.

If you find slang terms or other difficult-to-understand passages in our documentation, use this section to search for alternatives.

Red Hat is committed to eliminating use of language that might exclude or offend certain groups of people. This chapter describes some considerations for use of inclusive language.

Also in this chapter is guidance on some common categories of ambiguity in writing and how to avoid it.

## [⁠]()4.1. Avoiding Misleading or Confusing Language

Some terms, phrases, and general language can be confusing if you are not a native speaker or if the phraseology has regional significance. Sometimes spelling changes are introduced over time and regions, based purely on differences in pronunciation. Some phrases can carry hidden or unintentional meanings. This section attempts to introduce a few examples.

best practices

This is a commonly understood phrase, and despite some concerns about using superlatives without statistics to back them up, Red Hat does not actively discourage its use. It is also a more common search term than most alternatives. If you are in any doubt, the preferred alternative is "recommended practices".

Refer to the section [Section 3.11, “Making Recommendations”](#making-recommendations) for additional information about recommendations in Red Hat documentation.

[⁠]()first come, first served

Indicates that customers will be attended to in the order that they arrive. The phrase abbreviates the sentence "The first to come is the first to be served", so use "served" instead of "serve" to keep the verb function the same. This phrase is an idiom, so avoid using it when content will be translated. When you use this phrase as an adjective, it is hyphenated as follows: Admittance is on a first-come, first-served basis.

## [⁠]()4.2. Identifying and Avoiding Slang

Examples of slang terms:

administrivia

Not a word. Do not use.

anything you like, anything they like

This phrase is probably readily understood but should not appear in Red Hat documentation.

- "They can also use the `slapi_register_plugin()` call to register any kind of plug-in they like."
  
  Rephrase to something more suitable, such as "... to register any other kind of plug-in."

apples to apples

Do not use. Explain instead what is meant, such as "a fair comparison".

ask (as a noun), make the ask

"To ask" is a verb. As a noun, "ask" is chiefly British and also considered informal. Do not use it in technical documentation.

at the end of the day

Do not use. Explain what you mean, such as "considering all factors", or omit.

at this point in time

Do not use. In most cases, use "now". In some cases it is acceptable to use "at this point", for example, when you have reached a specific point in a procedure.

automagic

Also, automagical. Both terms are slang. Do not use.

best-of-breed

Jargon. Say exactly what you mean, for example, "the best product in its class" or "the best product of its type". Other alternatives include best, foremost, most advanced, and optimum. The category is usually implied. Be wary of using superlatives without data to back up any claims.

bleeding edge

Do not use.

boil the ocean

Do not use. State exactly what you mean, such as "increase the scope hugely".

bottom line

Traditionally used in financial contexts; avoid overuse.

bucketize

Not a word. Try "categorize" or "organize into logical groups".

center of competency

Do not use.

core competency

Jargon, cold and impersonal. Better choices include "specialization", "skill", "strength", "expertise", and so on.

data point

Do not use.

dig deeper, delve deeper

"Visit the following web link to dig deeper into \[subject] ...". Using "dig deeper" might translate awkwardly. Consider rewording: "For detailed information regarding \[subject], refer to \[link]."

drop the ball

State instead exactly what you mean, such as "make a mistake".

double-edged sword, double-bladed sword

If something is described as a double-edged sword, it indicates that it has two opposing behaviors or consequences. Instead, state that it can have unexpected consequences, or that the positive result might be offset by the negative result.

eat your own dogfood

Jargon. It means to use your own products. You can get a detailed description at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat\_one%27s\_own\_dog\_food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one%27s_own_dog_food).

enterprise-ready

Although Red Hat used to use this term to emphasize its products' enterprise readiness, it is not as necessary now, especially when talking about a product with "Enterprise" in its name, unless you are calling this out as a key selling point.

exceed your expectations

Vague. Clarify with specifics, for example, "The movie made more money on the opening weekend than anyone expected." instead of "The movie exceeded our expectations."

fib

A fib is a "small lie", also known as a "white lie". For example, "This command tells fibs" is better written as "The output of this command can be misleading".

flog a dead horse

Do not use. Explain exactly what you mean, such as "a waste of effort".

fly by the seat of your pants

Slang. Generally understood to mean "reacting to events as they occur". Difficult to offer alternatives without context.

frame it up

Do not use.

frown upon

"To frown upon" means to hold in low regard, not to approve of, and so on. For example: "... we generally frown on the use of session context ...". This translates to (and should have been written as) "... the use of session context is not recommended ..." (or words to that effect).

fuzzy (search)

Even though "fuzzy" is slang, it is common when referring to searches, especially in databases. This example came from the Directory Server documentation:

- In Directory Server, if you do a fuzzy search for "Smith", you will probably also get "Smyth", because it sounds the same.

The use of "fuzzy" is valid in this context.

Note the difference between this and "wildcard" searches: "Sm?th" could return "Smith", "Smyth", "Smeth", or even "Smrth".

Do not use "fuzzy" to describe something that is not clear, such as an image, a concept, an idea, and so on. For example, "He was a bit fuzzy on the details" is not valid.

going-forward basis

Jargon. Say "from now on", "in the future", or something similar.

happy path

Do not use. Often understood to mean "a path or method of least resistance" or "the preferred way to solve the current issue", this is localized slang and could easily be misunderstood. It could also produce problems for translation.

harness the power

Do not use.

have a crack at, jump right in

Have a crack at and jump right in are closely related in meaning as they imply to "get started or give it a try". Alternatives to these are "start", "try", and "begin", and will depend on the context of what is being discussed.

if you want, if you wish

Do not use. For example, instead of saying "If you want to perform an action, ..." say "To perform an action, ...".

in concert with

Do not use. Instead, say "with". For example, change "Use gcov in concert with GCC to analyze ..." to "Use gcov with GNU CC to analyze ..."

improve, enhance

Vague. Try to be more specific.

in a pinch

Under a tight schedule, hard pressed to achieve something.

is designed to

Avoid this and similar phrases when describing products and services. Instead, state what the product does.

- Incorrect: SSH is designed to work with almost any kind of public key algorithm or encoding format.
- Correct: SSH works with almost any kind of public key algorithm or encoding format.

kettle of fish

Commonly used in the expression "a different kettle of fish", meaning "that is a different matter (altogether)". Depending on the context, use "topic", "subject", "matter", or something similar.

leverage

Avoid. Alternatives include "use" and "take advantage of".

lights on, lights-on

Avoid using this term, because 1) it is jargon, 2) not everyone knows what it means, and 3) the meaning could be lost or confused in translation to other languages.

It is typically used to mean maintaining the *status quo* or just doing what is required to keep things up and running (versus being proactive and innovative). For example, "A cloud can deliver strategic advantages to the business by redirecting resources from lights-on to innovation."

low-hanging fruit

Metaphor. Do not use. Instead, describe the outcome or opportunity in more precise terms, such as "readily achievable goals" or "low-risk, high-yield opportunities".

meet your needs

Vague. Try to be more specific, for example, "lower your middleware costs".

mission-critical

Overused and jargony. Unless the topic is actually critical to a mission, use a factual term or phrase, for example, "Ensure that you have the applications that you need to help your customers." versus "Ensure that you have the mission-critical applications that your customers demand."

net-net

Jargon. Use "in summary", "the end result", or something similar.

niche focus

Do not use.

on the same page

Instead of "ensure that everyone is on the same page", use wording such as "ensure that everyone is aligned" or "ensure that everyone is in agreement".

over the wire

Commonly used in expressions such as "password information is sent in plain text over the wire", meaning "sent unencrypted through the transmission medium" (whether it is a wired or wireless network, the internet, or whatever). The phrase is probably not required at all. "Sent or transmitted in plain text" is fine.

paradigm

Avoid. Use "model", "standard", or something similar.

performant

In the technical industry context, it means "performs as expected" or "well-performing". It is not necessarily a word everyone knows (and technically, it means "a performer", as in a play, according to most dictionaries), so use an alternative if possible.

piggyback

Slang. Do not use.

pre-baked, prebaked

Means "prepared beforehand". Choose a suitable alternative, such as "preconfigured", depending on the context.

productize

Not a word. Find another way to say "modify something to become suitable as a commercial product". \[wiktionary]

ready to rumble

"Let's get ready to rumble!" is a trademarked catchphrase used to introduce televised boxing or wrestling events. In US English slang, being "ready to rumble" means you are "ready to go ahead" or "ready to start".

rest on your laurels

Do not use.

right before doing something

Preferred phrase would be "immediately before doing something". Otherwise, write around the phrase.

root your server in the `/serverRoot` directory

This expression is inelegant. Be aware of the multiple meanings of words. Try something like "Use the `/serverRoot` directory as the root directory for your server."

shoot yourself in the foot

To "shoot yourself in the foot" indicates that you did something to harm your own cause, or acting against your own best interests. Remove the sentence; it should be self-evident from the surrounding information.

shy of

Apart from the "normal" meaning of shy, it is also found in such phrases as "he was just shy of the mark", meaning that he did not quite succeed. Also, to be "a few items shy of what is required" means to have fewer than the minimum required number. Avoid this terminology and use more easily understood terms; it helps translators and also those reading English documentation who are unfamiliar with such slang.

silo, siloed

Use "stand-alone", "confined", "separated", or something similar.

solutions-based

Do not use.

solution stack

Do not use.

stovepipe

Jargon. In business, related to lack of cross-organizational communication, similar to "silo".

synergistic, synergy

Jargon. Use "cooperative", "working together", "collaborative", "harmonious", or something similar.

to think outside the box

Use "think creatively" or "think unconventionally" or rephrase completely.

tunnel vision

Do not use.

under the covers

This refers to something being out of plain sight or not immediately obvious. For example, you might only see the results of some action or command, but what happens "under the covers" is what is going on in the background, that you cannot see or are not aware of, to make that action of command possible.

value-added

Jargon. Say "added value" or "valuable". Or be more specific, for example, "adds value by improving productivity".

very

Use with caution. For example, there is little value in saying "very cost-effective" versus "cost-effective".

virtual elephants

This refers to a group of blind-folded people all touching different parts of an elephant and trying to describe what it is. Nobody sees the "big picture". Curiously, it appeared in an STC article about working in global and virtual teams and using effective communication. It falls into the same category as "skeletons in the closet", "dark horse", "black sheep", and so on. Use descriptions and adjectives that are not specific to a particular culture or locale. Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind\_Men-anElephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Men-anElephant) for more information.

## [⁠]()4.3. Neologisms (Invented Words)

The English language is full of these words. Some of them are useful; some of them are less so; others are just painful, difficult to translate, and should be avoided. Many of them are the result of creating nouns from verbs, verbs from nouns, and adjectives from just about anything. Unless a particular word has been in use for some time and is generally accepted into common English, try to avoid these neologisms. If necessary, reword or restructure your sentences.

[⁠]()

**Examples**

- "This feature allows synchronization of adds, deletes, and changes ..."
  
  - This sentence converted three verbs to nouns. A better structure might be, "This feature allows the synchronization of add, delete, and change operations ..."

## [⁠]()4.4. Phrasal Verbs

Avoid using two-word verb forms (*phrasal verbs*) if a one-word equivalent exists.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.1.** 

 Example Improvement click on click fill in, fill out (a form) complete (a form) leave out omit print out print

## [⁠]()4.5. Anthropomorphism

Anthropomorphism is applying human qualities to non-human things or animals. Avoid it in your writing.

[⁠]()

**Examples**

- The computer will think for a brief period.
  
  - Computers do not actually think but they might take a while to "process" commands.
- The Proxy Server is talking to either RHN Hosted or a Satellite Server.
  
  - It is quite common to say "talk to" in this context, but "communicate with", "connected to", "registered with", or something similar would be better.

### [⁠]()4.5.1. Use of "Allow"

Except when referring specifically to permission, avoid stating that a product or feature allows the user to do something.

[⁠]()

**Example 4.1.  Valid Uses of "Allow" to Refer to Permission**

Some open source licenses allow code to be reused in proprietary products.

You can configure the `sudo` command to allow specific users to run any command as some other user.

In cases that do not refer to permission, whenever possible, focus instead on what the user, service, or agent does, or replace "allow" with a different verb, such as "enable".

[⁠]()

**Table 4.2.** 

 Example Improvement Using the ausearch command allows administrators to focus on only the messages they are interested in. Administrators can use the ausearch command to focus on only messages of interest. Collections allow updates to the core Ansible code to be separated from updates to modules and plug-ins. You can use collections to separate core Ansible code updates from updates to modules and plug-ins. The system menu allows you to switch network and VPN connections on or off.

## [⁠]()4.6. Inclusive Language

Chris Wright, Red Hat Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President, Global Engineering, affirms in a blog post a commitment for Red Hat to identify and replace problematic language that is potentially divisive and does not foster inclusion:

[https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language)

Follow these guiding principles:

Do not use the terms "white" or "black" in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad, such as "whitelist" and "blacklist". Such usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.

For alternatives, choose words that describe the action that is taken or the function that is performed, rather than a metaphor for that action or function, for example "allowlist" instead of "whitelist", or "blocklist" or "denylist" instead of "blacklist".

Do not use "master" when it is paired with "slave". The master and slave mount propagation terminology that is used in Linux is problematic and divisive, and needs to be changed. When naming the default branch name for a GitHub repository, use "main" instead of "master". Use of "master" is acceptable in other contexts, such as to refer to mastery of a skill.

Avoid gender bias. As an example, do not assume that the subject of a sentence is male if the context might refer to any gender. Thus, instead of using "man hours", use "labor hours" or "person hours". Avoid binary gendered language, such as "he" or "she", except to refer to a specific named person. Do not use "he or she". Instead, use the ungendered "they" as the preferred pronoun.

Avoid neurodiversity bias. For example, avoid the terms "sanity check" and "sanity test", and do not use "disabled" to refer to a person.

Avoid superlatives in job titles and descriptions, especially problematic terms such as "guru", "ninja", "rockstar", or "evangelist".

Such guidance, including judgement of what constitutes acceptable versus unacceptable use, will evolve over time.

## [⁠]()4.7. Avoiding Redundant Words

Avoid redundant words, such as "actually", "really", "simply", and "very". They are typically filler words that add no value to a sentence.

Redundant words might also occur where two words or phrases are used that mean approximately the same thing, such as "revert back" versus "revert", or that add nothing to the sentence, such as "located on" versus "on".

Restore the LUKS2 header to the encrypted volume on the `/dev/sda1` partition.

## [⁠]()4.8. Avoiding Ambiguities

[⁠]() Avoid May and Should

The verb "may" might indicate possibility or grant permission. Similarly, "should" might imply a recommendation or express obligation or expectation. A sentence containing one of these verbs often has a double meaning. Avoid these types of words.

**Table 4.4.** 

 Example Improvement The `next()` method should return `null` to indicate the end of results.

*Or:* It might be held in memory.

[⁠]() Avoid Stating that Something Is Easy

Avoid stating that a task is easy to do or that a product is easy to use. Avoid "friendly" and "user-friendly" and similar terms. Focus instead on how to perform a task or on relevant features of a product.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.5.** 

 Example Improvement Mounting a device is relatively simple. Identify the device for mounting, ensure that the mount point exists, and mount the device on the mount point. (Omit the first sentence.)

Kubernetes is an open source system that manages containerized applications across multiple hosts.

[⁠]() Capitalizing Proper Nouns

In some cases it is not clear if a term refers to a concept or a proper noun or product name. By using the correct capitalization, you help translators identify untranslatable proper nouns and Red Hat product names.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.6.** 

 Example Improvement This property must be enabled when you are using CTDB in a Windows domain or in active directory security mode. This property must be enabled when you are using CTDB in a Windows domain or in Active Directory security mode.

[⁠]() Homonymity

When a single term has multiple meanings, be explicit to differentiate between them.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.7.** 

 Example Improvement To create another administrator, click **File &gt; New**.

To create another administrator account, click **File &gt; New**.

*Or:* To set privileges for another administrator, click **File &gt; New**.

**Note**

Refer also to [Section 5.2, “Grammatical Genders”](#genders).

[⁠]()Infinitives

When you have more than one infinitive verb within a sentence, be clear what each verb refers to.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.8.** 

 Example Improvement Use the utility to run activities and save your settings. Depending on the meaning:

Use the utility to run activities and to save your settings (if the utility does both functions).

*Or:* Use the utility to run activities, and then save your settings (if the process consists of two separate steps, of which the utility does only one).

[⁠]() Invisible Plurals

Some two-word phrases (noun + noun) do not clarify whether the first noun is singular or plural.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.9.** 

 Example Improvement Once the file retrieval has been completed, you are ready to restart your system. After the files have been retrieved, you can restart your system.

[⁠]() Misplaced Only

Ensure that "only" is placed directly before the word that it modifies, which often should not be a verb.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.10.** 

 Example Improvement

Users can only delete files that they own.

(Misleadingly suggests that users cannot take any actions other than deletion on those files)

Users can delete only files that they own.

(Clarifies the files that deletion applies to)

[⁠]()Pronouns

Avoid ambiguous pronoun references, where a pronoun can refer to more than one antecedent.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.11.** 

 Example Improvement If the completed field contains text, it does not change. If the completed field contains text, that text does not change.

[⁠]()Synonymity

Sometimes multiple terms have a single meaning. If terms are used inconsistently, users (and translators) might assume they refer to different things. It is best to use a single term for a single concept throughout.

For example, "Administration UI" and "Administration Console" could both be used to refer to a single application or to different applications. For this reason it is important that writers choose the most suitable term for each situation and use it consistently.

[⁠]()Use of "There Is" and "There Are"

Avoid "there is", "there are", and "there might be", because the subject of the sentence is unclear.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.12.** 

 Example Improvement The initial error message suggests there is a failure when opening a file. The initial error message suggests a failure when opening a file. There are multiple static inventory formats supported by Ansible. Ansible supports multiple static inventory formats.

[⁠]()Use of "Using"

Use of the word "using" can result in ambiguity, which can often be resolved by using "that uses" or "by using", according to the meaning.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.13.** 

 Example Improvement Open the firewall ports using the existing service configuration.

Option 1: Open the firewall ports by using the existing service configuration.

Option 2: Use the existing service configuration to open the firewall ports.

The resource agents using mail alerts require a mail transport agent. The resource agents that use mail alerts require a mail transport agent.

[⁠]()Verb Phrases

Ensure that a verb phrase at the start of a sentence modifies the correct word.

[⁠]()

**Table 4.14.** 

 Example Improvement Having configured your environment, the product is ready to be used. (The product does not configure the environment.) After you configure your environment, you can use the product.

## [⁠]()4.9. Dates and Times

Do not use an all-numeric representation for dates. For example, 9/12/2020 means September 12, 2020 in the US but 9 December 2020 in most other countries. Instead, write the month as a word.

Instead of writing "The product was manufactured on 4/1/21", which is ambiguous, use a format in running text where the month is represented as a word rather than as a numeral, such as "The product was manufactured on 1 April 2021".

Exception: Use of an all-numeric representation is allowed when space is limited, as in a user interface, or to enhance readability. In such cases, use the ISO date format with a 4-digit year (YYYY-MM-DD) and define the format in a header or legend.

For times of day, use uppercase without periods, such as "11 AM". Use a nonbreaking space between the numeral and "AM" or "PM".

Use "noon" or "12 noon" instead of "12 PM". Use "midnight" or "12 midnight" instead of "12 AM".

**Examples**

- The training class begins at 10 AM on 1 April 2021.
- The coffee break is from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM.

## [⁠]()4.10. Numbers

Spell out the following number types: numbers zero through nine, any number that begins a sentence, a number that precedes another number (four 6-pound bags; eleven 20-pound bags), approximations (thousands of ...), and very large values.

Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater, and for numbers less than 10 if they appear in the same paragraph as numbers of 10 or greater (for example, "You answered 8 out of 14 questions correctly"). Use numerals for negative numbers, fractions, percentages, decimals, measurements, and references to publication sections (for example, Chapter 3, Table 5, Page 11). Also use numerals when referring to registers (such as R1), code (such as x = 6), and release versions (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, Linux kernel 4.18).

Do not use commas in numbers with four digits (use 1000 rather than 1,000). Use commas, to separate groups of three digits, in numbers with five or more digits (such as 10,000; 123,456,789; 1,000,000,000).

Refer to *The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition* for detailed information on numbering formats.

### [⁠]()4.10.1. Phone numbers

Use spaces, not dashes or dots, to punctuate phone numbers. When indicating a number for international use, include the country code (+1 555 555 5555 for a US number, for example). US 800 numbers are not accessible from outside the country, so do not precede them with a country code (800 555 5555). Phone numbers beginning with 0 are not for international use. Make these numbers ready for international use by dropping the zero and adding the appropriate country code. For example, (055) 12345 would be for use in Italy only; change it to +39 (55) 12345 for international use.

This chapter provides guidelines, tips, and techniques to help to make your writing easier to read and understand, and also to translate.

## [⁠]()5.1. Sentence Structure

This section describes how to construct your content for clarity and readability. A full discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this guide.

### [⁠]()5.1.1. Using and Formatting Lists

Lists appear in a range of formats, such as series, ordered, unordered (bulleted), and so on. Avoid using bulleted lists to format a single sentence. Some translation tools display list items and the introductory sentence (or *sentence stem*) as individual sentences for translation. If they are not complete sentences, they can be difficult to translate.

The following general guidelines apply to lists:

Bulleted lists

Use this list type when the order of items is not important. In most cases, a bulleted list should have three or more entries. In limited cases, specific publications might choose instead to allow fewer entries in a list. Titles are optional.

Ordered lists

These appear as numbered lists. Use this list type for multiple entries if you need to refer to one of the entries from elsewhere in your document, or where order is important. For example, use an ordered list for a sequence of steps to complete a task, or for a sequence of events. Titles are optional.

Variable lists

These appear as a list of terms followed by definitions. Use this list type to list and describe a series of terms, such as variables, command options or arguments, and similar items. Titles are optional. (This list is written as a variable list.) A variable list is often preferable to a table, because tables have the additional overhead of calculating column width for every translation. Tables are best reserved for information that relies on, or benefits greatly from, a grid layout.

Procedures

These appear as a list of numbered steps. Procedures always include a title, and are used to list the required steps to achieve a task.

You can nest lists, but try to keep the number of levels to two or fewer.

#### [⁠]()5.1.1.1. Formatting Lists for Readability

It is important to provide enough spacing between elements in your documents to facilitate reading and comprehension. You can include a lot of information in a few short paragraphs but readers need to be able to process that information in chunks. The same consideration applies to lists.

In some authoring environments, you can choose between normal or compact spacing for lists. Use a list with normal spacing if any list item contains the following components:

- Nested lists. Nested list items themselves can use the `compact` attribute if they fall outside the bounds of these recommendations.
- Navigation or similar instructions (such as "Go to Menu -&gt; Submenu").
- Multiple paragraphs, or sentences that wrap to two or more lines.
- Other sections where your deliverables might benefit from more spacing between list items, for example a list of objectives in a training course.

Use a list with compact spacing in all other cases.

**Note**

The use of all but the simplest graphics in lists is strongly discouraged.

The following explanation provides some initial guidance for using lists correctly. For a detailed explanation, refer to [*Lists*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=format-lists) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

Do not insert a list midway through a sentence and then continue the sentence after the list.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.1.** 

 Example Improvement

Before you start the installation, ensure that you have

- enough free storage on your system
- backed up any data that you want to keep

to ensure a smooth installation.

Before you start the installation, follow these prerequisite steps:

- Ensure that you have enough free storage on your system.
- Back up any data that you want to keep.

For a lead-in sentence that introduces a list, use a complete sentence. A lead-in that is a sentence fragment can be difficult to translate into other languages.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.2.** 

 Example Improvement

Non-privileged users can use the role to configure:

- Interface 1
- Interface 2

Non-privileged users can use the role to configure the following interfaces:

- Interface 1
- Interface 2

Make items in a list grammatically parallel.

In the following example, the original three list items inconsistently use an infinitive verb form, and then a gerund, and then an imperative. In the improved example, all three list items consistently use an imperative statement.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.3.** 

 Example Improvement

- To obtain the file name of the default kernel with the `grubby` command:
- Finding the index number of the default kernel:
- Use the `grubby` command to persistently change the default kernel:

<!--THE END-->

- Obtain the file name of the default kernel with the `grubby` command:
- Find the index number of the default kernel:
- Use the `grubby` command to persistently change the default kernel:

#### [⁠]()5.1.1.2. Punctuation in Lists

For each item in a list, start with either a complete sentence or a sentence fragment.

A *complete sentence* must include a subject and a verb. It conveys a complete thought, and can stand on its own.

For a list where all items are complete sentences, end each item with a period.

Example:

Which statement is true about deployments and deployment configurations?

- Deployments use replica sets, and deployment configurations use replication controllers.
- Deployments use replication controllers, and deployment configurations use replica sets.
- Deployments and deployment configurations both refer to the same thing.
- Deployments use replica sets, and deployment configurations use stateful sets.

For a list where all items are sentence fragments, do not end the items with any punctuation.

Example:

Kubernetes networking provides the following capabilities:

- Highly coupled container-to-container communications
- Pod-to-pod communications
- Pod-to-service communications
- External-to-service communications

Sometimes, list items might include some form of a verb, but if they do not also include a subject, then they are not capable of standing on their own. Such items count as sentence fragments, and are not ended with any punctuation.

Example:

Common uses for jobs include the following tasks:

- Initializing or migrating a database
- Calculating one-off metrics from information within the cluster
- Creating or restoring from a data backup

Example:

Consider the following settings when creating a route:

- An optional path, for path-based routes
- A target port that the application listens to
- An encryption strategy, depending on whether you need a secure or an insecure route

For a list where the items start with sentence fragments, and any of those fragments are followed by a complete sentence, end each of the fragments and sentences with a period.

Example:

- Identifier of the object schema version.
- Schema identifier. In this example, the object conforms to the pod schema.
- Name of the container inside a pod. Container names are important for `oc` commands when a pod contains multiple containers.

For information about punctuation in lead-in sentences that introduce a list, refer to [To Introduce a List, Command, Code Block, or Procedure](#list-intro-punc).

### [⁠]()5.1.2. Noun Stacking

Modifier strings (modifier + noun + noun sentence format) and over-modified nouns (or *noun stacks*) are especially difficult to translate, particularly when several different combinations might make sense. Avoid a stack of more than three consecutive nouns.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.4.** 

 Example Improvement Plastic tubing and syringe tips. Plastic tubing and plastic syringe tips. Set default printer configuration parameters for new users. Enter the maximum length of time that you want to keep the automatic synchronization address list updates in days and press Enter. For new users, set the parameters to the default printer configuration. Enter the maximum length of time, in number of days, that you want to keep the address lists updated by automatic synchronization. Then, press Enter. Standard system log management configuration rotates log files every week. Standard configuration of system log management rotates log files every week.

Avoid a noun followed by a word that ends in *-ing*. Such a construction is difficult to translate.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.5.** 

 Example Improvement The `nmap` utility scans privileged TCP ports looking for services. The `nmap` utility scans privileged TCP ports to look for services.

## [⁠]()5.2. Grammatical Genders

When using ambiguous pronouns such as "they" or "it", it is not always clear what they refer to. For languages that have different genders for nouns, it is important to know exactly what each pronoun refers to. For example, the word "it" can be translated in several different ways and might require other grammatical adjustments.

Further, an initialism such as *RPM* might refer to the package or to the package manager. In German, *manager* is a masculine noun, and so RPM requires the masculine article "der" when it refers to the RPM Package Manager. *Package* is a neuter noun, and requires the neuter article "das" when it refers to an RPM package.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.6.** 

 Example Improvement Set the parameter XYZ to 1 in the configuration file `/etc/config.conf`. It configures the way the Gateway application handles incoming network traffic. Set the XYZ parameter to 1 in the `/etc/config.conf` configuration file. This parameter configures how the Gateway application handles incoming network traffic. The RPM is useful. The RPM package is useful. *OR* The RPM Package Manager is useful.

## [⁠]()5.3. Using Markup Correctly

If you use a markup language to write your content, make the most of the available tagging options. Many terms are not translatable, and should not be used as structural parts of a sentence.

Correctly marking up terms can help translators to understand the meaning of, and to identify, translatable and non-translatable terms.

[⁠]()

**Table 5.7.** 

 Example Improvement In `/some/path/`, grep for XYZ. In the `/some/path/` directory, use the `grep` command to search for "XYZ". `param-2` contains a reference to the hostname return value from `instance-2`. The `param-2` parameter contains a reference to the hostname return value from your second server instance, `instance-2`. Troubleshoot Glance. Troubleshoot the Glance image service. Install the maven-changelog-plugin. Install the maven-changelog-plugin package.

**Note**

This guide does not try to cover the many ways that you can use markup languages to write content. Many online resources exist for these languages.

## [⁠]()5.4. Code Blocks

Avoid including commentary within the same box as command input or output. These comments might be confused with part of the output, and during translation might be accidentally overlooked and left in English.

For example, consider the word "Usage" in the following block:

```
Usage: rhevm-iso-uploader [options] list
rhevm-iso-uploader [options] upload [file1] [file2] [file3]
```

For information about punctuation in lead-in sentences that introduce a code block, refer to [To Introduce a List, Command, Code Block, or Procedure](#list-intro-punc).

## [⁠]()5.5. Entities

An entity is a primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as #DEFAULT) [⁠]()[\[4\]](#ftn.id4585). Entities are called by reference, and take the form &amp;name; (both the ampersand and the semicolon are required).

Entities can be helpful in some cases, but they are more of a hindrance when used for terms that need translation. Translators must compare the string with the built document to determine what the entity stands for. These entities might even be overlooked and not be translated at all.

To avoid issues with incorrect or outdated entity values, problems with translation, and so on, only include the entities that are required to build your books. If you use Publican ([https://fedorahosted.org/publican/](https://fedorahosted.org/publican/)) to create and maintain your documentation, it creates and populates the required entities with default values when you create a publication. Required entities vary by brand; only the following entities are required for a standard publication:

- PRODUCT
- BOOKID
- YEAR
- HOLDER

Do not include entities such as &amp;PRODNAME; or &amp;VERSION; and so on, or things like &amp;BIBLE; to represent "The King James Bible". To learn more about entities, refer to the relevant chapter in [http://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-US/Publican/4.0/html/Users\_Guide/index.html](http://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-US/Publican/4.0/html/Users_Guide/index.html)

## [⁠]()Chapter 6. Using Cross-references Effectively

[6.1. The Additional Information Test](#additional-information)

[6.2. The Information/Link Ratio](#informationlink-ratio)

[6.3. Repetition](#repeatability-test)

This section contains suggestions on how to use cross-references in the most effective way: that is, so that they work for the reader rather than for the author. Formatting is not described in this section.

In the days of print-only documentation, cross-references referred readers to additional or related information that existed elsewhere in the physical printed publication, on other pages. The readers had to physically turn pages to find the referenced page, so authors, editors, and proofreaders developed a certain caution about scattering cross-references through the text. Despite the ease of use and creation of cross-references and links in online documents today, the author must still do the work for the reader. The author must still do the heavy lifting and arrange the information so that the reader can absorb it in the smoothest possible fashion. Forcing the reader to leap from link to link might indicate that the author is writing for their own ease, and not for the good of the reader.

## [⁠]()6.1. The Additional Information Test

Is the cross-reference pointing to vital information or additional information?

A cross-reference should always point to additional information, not to core information that the reader needs to perform the task at hand. For example, in a procedure to configure an application, do not merely provide a link to the appendix where the correct naming conventions are described. Give the reader examples and explanations of a valid file name, and at the end of the procedure, provide a link to the appendix.

## [⁠]()6.2. The Information/Link Ratio

Does the paragraph or section consist largely of links?

In running text, each paragraph should contain no more than a couple of links. Links should not occur in every paragraph, and they must not occur in titles, subheadings, or figure captions. Cross-references interrupt the flow of thought, and can actively interfere with the absorption of information. If the reader needs much extra information, rethink the structure of the section, and enrich the quality of the information. Do not let the cross-references overpower the message. A solution is to add a sentence to the end of the section to indicate where to find more information.

**Note**

Lists can be an exception, but try to provide the reader with a descriptive phrase or sentence for each cross-referenced item, as well as a lead-in and a concluding sentence for the paragraph that contains the list.

## [⁠]()6.3. Repetition

Repetition is a useful tool for reinforcing new knowledge and skills, emphasizing important ideas, and providing readers with important information at their point of need.

Repeating necessary information also saves the reader time and effort. In some circumstances, such as when using online help, the reader is trying to answer an immediate question or to solve a problem. In a safety situation, it is important for the reader to find critical information quickly.

If the information is vital, and must appear in multiple places, then it must be repeated. Any vital information, which is not more than a couple of paragraphs (or half a page, or five rows of a table), can be repeated rather than be cross-referenced to.

## [⁠]()Chapter 7. Resources

[7.1. References for Technical Content](#tech-content-refs)

This section lists some helpful resources for creating effective technical content.

The type of content that you are writing will determine which resources are most relevant. In general, consult company-specific style guides before general resources. The guidelines in the following references sometimes contradict each other. It does not mean that the guidelines are wrong; rather, different audiences and genres require different writing styles, and different references are sometimes required when you change styles.

The following technical content types are within the scope of this guide:

- Software manuals and documentation
- Training courses
- User guides
- White papers

The following content types are outside the scope of this guide:

- Marketing content: advertising, articles, press releases, promotions
- Corporate content about the company or its products

## [⁠]()Chapter 9. A

[⁠]()"&amp;" and "+"

Ampersands or plus signs can be used instead of the word "and" in design elements and graphics when space is limited, and when either referring to or quoting third-party content that uses them. Do not use them in original body copy.

[⁠]()AArch64, aarch64

*n.* A 64-bit version of the ARM architecture. Use this term when referring to operating systems and server instances, for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CoreOS, and other Linux distributions.

Use the uppercase (AArch64) format in general cases when referring to system architecture. Use the lowercase (aarch64) format only when referring to objects or parameters. It can be styled as code (monospace font or a code-styled block) when referring to code.

Cloud providers might use different formats of this term to refer to architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, then confer with your subject-matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

Examples:

- When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux with an AArch64 system, run the following commands:
- Specify the system architecture of your cluster, such as `x86_64` or `aarch64`.

Refer also to [64-bit ARM](#a64-bit), [64-bit x86](#a64-bit-x86), [AMD64, amd64](#AMD64), [ARM64, arm64](#ARM64), [Intel 64](#Intel64), and [x86\_64](#x86-64).

[⁠]()above

Do not use to refer to information that was mentioned previously. When documents are converted to online format, the information might no longer be "above". Use a cross-reference if the referenced material is sufficiently removed, or write "as mentioned previously" instead.

[⁠]()agile, agile development

*adj.* Use only as an adjective. It is not a proper noun, nor is it owned or trademarked and should not be capitalized.

[⁠]()air gap, air wall

*n.* Use "air gap" to describe systems that are separated, not by software, but physically. Do not use "air wall". "Air gap" is preferred in technical publications because there is no actual wall that you need to breach, but rather a gap that you need to bridge. You cannot break through something that does not exist.

[⁠]()all-in-one

*n., adj.* Write as shown as both a noun and an adjective. Do not use other variations.

[⁠]()alternate

*v.* "Alternate" as a verb means to change between two states or options.

Refer also to [alternative](#alternative).

[⁠]()alternative

*adj.* Describes another way or method of doing something. "Alternate" (vb.) means to change between two states or options. If you mean "another way of doing something", use "an alternative method is to ...".

Refer also to [alternate](#alternate).

[⁠]()AM

For times of day, use uppercase without periods, and use a preceding nonbreaking space after the numeral, for example "11 AM".

Refer also to [PM](#pm).

[⁠]()AMD64, amd64

*n.* The AMD 64-bit version of the x86 architecture. Use this term for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform attributes, Kubernetes, operators, application programming interfaces (APIs), or command-line interface (CLI) objects.

Use the uppercase format (AMD64) in general sentences when referring to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform features. Use the lowercase format (amd64) only when referring to objects or parameters. It can be styled as code (monospace font or a code-styled block) when referring to code.

Cloud providers might use different formats of this term to refer to architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, then confer with your subject-matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

Examples:

- This operator is supported on AMD64 and ARM64 platforms.
- In this scenario, `amd64` is a valid value for X.

Refer also to [64-bit ARM](#a64-bit), [64-bit x86](#a64-bit-x86), [AArch64, aarch64](#aarch64), [ARM64, arm64](#ARM64), [Intel 64](#Intel64), and [x86\_64](#x86-64).

[⁠]()ARM64, arm64

*n.* A 64-bit version of the ARM architecture. Use this term for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform attributes, Kubernetes, operators, application programming interfaces (APIs), and command-line interface (CLI) objects.

Use the uppercase format (ARM64) in general sentences when referring to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform features. Use lowercase format (arm64) only when referring to objects or parameters. It can be styled as code (monospace font or a code-styled block) when referring to code.

Cloud providers might use different formats of this term to refer to architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, then confer with your subject-matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

Examples:

- In this exercise, you create an ARM64 compute machine set.
- In this scenario, `arm64` is a valid value for X.

Refer also to [64-bit ARM](#a64-bit), [64-bit x86](#a64-bit-x86), [AArch64, aarch64](#aarch64), [AMD64, amd64](#AMD64), [Intel 64](#Intel64), and [x86\_64](#x86-64).

[⁠]()and/or

Avoid if possible. Try to rewrite to make the available options explicit and clear. Do not write *this and/or that*. Write *this or that, or both*.

[⁠]()appendixes

Correct. This is the correct plural form for US English spelling. Do not use "appendices".

[⁠]()application velocity

Used on its own, this phrase does not indicate what aspect of the application lifecycle is faster, because velocity means "speed in a given direction.”

Always provide context on first mention for what exactly is moving faster (for example, application development velocity, development velocity, development and deployment velocity). Then, unless the meaning changes, you can use “application velocity” for subsequent uses.

For example, the OpenShift team has used this term to mean "creating a streamlined developer experience" whose context is key to setting audience expectations for their content.

[⁠]()Applixware, Applix, ApplixWare

"Applixware" is correct. Do not use "Applix" or "ApplixWare".

architect

Do not use as a verb. Even though it might make sense in the correct context, using it as a verb can be jargon or be unclear for your audience. Use "design", "build", "create", or another descriptive verb instead. Before replacing the verb form of "architect" during the editing process, clarify with the writer the intended meaning. For example, a sentence that mentions rearchitecting might require "refactoring" as a replacement rather than "rebuilding".

[⁠]()artificial intelligence (AI)

Unless clarity requires it or the concept is being introduced or explained, "artificial intelligence" does not have to be spelled out on first use; "AI" is understood and suffices. When spelling it out, do not capitalize the term.

[⁠]()as-a-Service

Some "as-a-Service" acronyms overlap. To avoid confusion, always spell out the full term on first use.

- DRaaS (Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service)
- CaaS (Cloud-as-a-Service, Communications-as-a-Service, [Containers-as-a-Service](#containers-as-a-service))
- UCaaS (Unified Communications-as-a-Service)
- FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service)
- SaaS (Search-as-a-Service, Security-as-a-Service, Storage-as-a-Service, or Software-as-a-Service)
- PaaS (Payments-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service)
- MaaS (Messaging-as-a-Service, Metal-as-a-Service)
- SECaaS (Security-as-a-Service)
- TDBaaS (Time-series Database-as-a-Service)

When using as-a-Service acronyms:

- Capitalize the noun (such as Platform, Software, Infrastructure) and Service, both when abbreviated and when written out.
- When in all capitals, such as a title or headline, the "aa" in the acronym remains lowercase (such as INTRODUCTION TO PaaS SOLUTIONS).
- Hyphenate when written out: Thing-as-a-Service. For two-word prefixes, do not include a hyphen between the first and second words, for example: Mobile Backend-as-a-Service. It can be used as an adjective to describe multiple: for example, when referring to IaaS, MaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, use as-a-Service offerings, as-a-Service products, or similar wording.
- Avoid use of an acronym if it could stand for more than one term in a single asset. for example, if you are writing content that discusses both Cloud-as-a-Service and Containers-as-a-Service.

[⁠]()as Code

Use camel case for both the full term and the acronym. Do not hyphenate. Some "as Code" acronyms might overlap. To avoid confusion, always spell out the full term on first use.

Examples:

- Configuration as Code (CaC)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Policy as Code (PaC)

[⁠]()as long as

Use only to refer to a comparison of length or time. Otherwise, use an alternative, such as "provided that".

[⁠]()as well as

Not interchangeable with "and". "As well as" used in a series places more emphasis on the items preceding it, whereas "and" places equal weight on all items in the series. For example, "We sell kitchen electronics and china, as well as some gourmet foods." But "We sell kitchen electronics, china, and silverware."

[⁠]()ATM

Initialism for Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a network technology based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size. The cell size used with ATM is relatively small compared to units that are used with older technologies.

[⁠]()autofs

Always lowercase. It refers to the kernel-based automount utility. No other forms are recognized.

## [⁠]()Chapter 10. B

[⁠]()back end, back-end, backend

*n.* Two words. Refers to software that performs the final stages of a process, or to tasks that are not visible to the user. For example, "each back end provides a set of calls".

*adj.* Hyphenate. For example, "when the back-end database processes a search operation …"

Use the one-word form only if it is part of the established product terminology, for example "Mobile Backend-as-a-Service", and when it is not being used to describe a generic process.

Refer also to [front end, front-end](#front-end)

[⁠]()backtrace

*n.* "Backtrace" is the most common term to refer to a stack trace (or stack backtrace), which is a report of the active stack frames (that is, function calls) at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. In contrast, the Python programming language calls its stack trace a "traceback", possibly because the stack frames are printed in the opposite order of those presented by gdb, the GNU Debugger. "Traceback" is the preferred term when referring to a Python stack trace.

[⁠]()backup, back up

Write as one word as an adjective or noun, or as two words as a verb.

- *adj.* One word. For example, "store the backup copies of important files in a secure location".
- *n.* One word. For example, "create a backup of your important files".
- *v.* Two words. For example, "always back up important files".

Do not use the hyphenated form, "back-up".

[⁠]()backwards compatible

Do not use. Instead, use "compatible with earlier versions" to refer to something that is compatible with older equipment or previous versions of software. Refer also to [forwards compatible](#forwards-compatible).

[⁠]()bandwidth

Correct. Bandwidth can refer to a range within a band of frequencies or wavelengths, or the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed time.

[⁠]()bare metal, bare-metal

*n.* Two words.

*adj.* Hyphenate.

[⁠]()basically

Do not use. For example, removing the word "basically" in the following sentence strengthens it: "This is how it is basically done." Refer also to [simply](#simply).

[⁠]()because, since, as

Do not use "since" or "as" to mean "because"; it is ambiguous. Use "because" to refer to a reason. Use "since" and "as" to indicate the passage of time.

[⁠]()below

Do not use to refer to information that follows later in a document. When documents are converted to online format, the information might no longer be "below". Use a cross-reference instead.

[⁠]()biannual, bimonthly, biweekly, semiweekly, semimonthly

People have trouble remembering whether biweekly means "every two weeks" or "twice a week". "Semiweekly" has a similar problem. Even though both terms have clear dictionary definitions, it is best to avoid them in favor of clear communication.

Instead of biweekly, write "every two weeks" or "every other week".

Instead of semiweekly, write "twice a week".

[⁠]()big data

*n., adj.* Always use lowercase. Do not capitalize except at the beginning of a sentence, or if it is part of a Red Hat product, service, solution, or business unit name. Refer also to [cloud](#cloud). Big data is also never hyphenated, even when used as a compound modifier.

[⁠]()bimodal IT

Gartner phrase for the combination of traditional (mode 1 or type 1) and modern (mode 2 or type 2) IT infrastructure and resources. Many ways exist to describe this combination approach; be sure to use the right phrase for your audience. Using only the Gartner term can alienate other analysts or those who are not familiar with Gartner's phrasing.

The practice of having both modes together is often referred to as hybrid, agile, or modern IT.

**Note**

Hybrid IT is a more general term, for example it could mean on-premises plus public cloud. Agile and modern IT can both carry an implication of "mode 2", so when using those terms, be specific about the exact technology combination that you mean.

[⁠]()BIND

Correct when referring to the DNS software. Do not use Bind.

[⁠]()BIOS

Correct. The plural form is BIOSes.

[⁠]()bit rate

Correct. Do not use "bitrate".

[⁠]()blacklist

Do not use. Use "denylist" or "blocklist".

Do not use the terms "white" or "black" in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad. Such usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.

[⁠]()Boolean

Correct. Named after George Boole, who first developed the concept.

According to [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** , it is acceptable to use "boolean" (lowercase) in API programming information when it refers to a primitive return type.

To set Boolean values in YAML files, use `true` or `false`, written lowercase, rather than `yes` or `no`, because YAML 1.2 and later versions do not support the latter syntax.

For example, the following scenario specifies that a task is run only one time:

```
- name: Pause 30 seconds
  ansible.builtin.pause:
    seconds: 30
   run_once: true
```

[⁠]()boot

*v.* To load the first piece of software that starts a computer. Because the operating system is essential for running all other programs, it is usually the first piece of software to load during the boot process.

*n.* Refers to starting up a computer, which involves loading the operating system and other basic software. A cold boot refers to starting a computer that is turned off. A warm boot refers to resetting a computer that is already running.

Boot is an abbreviation of bootstrap, which in olden days was a strap attached to the top of your boot that you could pull to help to get your boot on. Hence, the expression "pull yourself up by the bootstraps". Similarly, bootstrap utilities help the computer to get started.

[⁠]()boot disk

Two words. Do not use "boot diskette".

[⁠]()boot loader

Two words. Do not use "bootloader".

[⁠]()bottleneck

One word. Do not use "bottle neck" or "bottle-neck".

A bottleneck refers to the delay in transmission of data through the circuits of a computer's microprocessor or over a TCP/IP network. The delay typically occurs when a system's bandwidth cannot support the amount of information that is being relayed at the speed that it is being processed. However, many factors can create a bottleneck in a system.

[⁠]()bpp

Initialism for bits per pixel. All letters are lowercase, unless at the beginning of a sentence. Use a non-breaking space between the numeral and the units. For example, "16 bpp", not "16bpp".

[⁠]()Bps, bps

The abbreviation of bytes per second is Bps. The abbreviation of bits per second is bps. To avoid confusion, do not use at the beginning of a sentence. Refer also to [bandwidth](#bandwidth).

[⁠]()breadcrumb, breadcrumb trail

For initial guidance on how to use this term, refer to [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** .

**Note**

Do not confuse the breadcrumb trail with the name of the actual page in a user interface. The final breadcrumb in the trail is the name of the page, unless the page itself offers a distinct title. The breadcrumb trail indicates the path that is taken to reach the current page.

[⁠]()![Example breadcrumb trail, showing Disks as the actual name of the page.](images/breadcrumb-trail-example.png)

Example breadcrumb trail, showing **Disks** as the actual name of the page.

break

(*v.*) Do not use to mean "break the system" or similar. For example, "applying an unapproved patch might break the system". Choose an alternative such as "cause the system to fail".

[⁠]()bring up

Do not use. Use "open" instead.

[⁠]()Britain

If referring to the language, say "English". If referring to the country, say the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or the UK. Using Britain or British is usually wrong and might imply a subjective statement about the state of Northern Ireland.

[⁠]()broadcast

To send the same message simultaneously to multiple recipients. Broadcasting is a useful feature in email systems.

In networking, a distinction is made between broadcasting and multicasting. Broadcasting sends a message to everyone on the network whereas multicasting sends a message to a selected list of recipients.

[⁠]()Btrfs

A copy-on-write file system for Linux. Use an uppercase "B" when referring to the file system. When referring to tools, commands, and other utilities that relate to the file system, be faithful to those utilities.

Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs) for more information on this file system.

Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_file\_systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_systems) for a list of file-system names and how to present them.

[⁠]()bug fix

Two words. Do not use "bugfix".

[⁠]()built-in

*adj.* Hyphenate. Do not use "builtin" unless referring specifically to "Bash builtins" or if it is otherwise a proper noun.

[⁠]()bunches of

Do not use, unless "bunch" is a specific term that is used in the documented software. Use "many" or some other alternative instead.

[⁠]()button

Describe a UI button as a "button", not a "pushbutton" or "push-button".

Ordinarily you would not include the text "button" in a procedure or description. For example, "Click **OK** to continue" is perfectly acceptable. It might be necessary to distinguish between buttons and links; for example, "Click the **Download** link".

Refer also to [Section 3.4, “Documenting the User Interface”](#documenting-ui).

## [⁠]()Chapter 11. C

[⁠]()call, called

Use to refer to code, programs, or scripts that invoke functions or methods. For example, "A liveness probe is called throughout the lifetime of the application."

On the other hand, when referring to the designation of files, objects, or entities within documentation, use the term "named" instead of "called". This choice promotes clarity and precision in technical content.

Refer also to [named](#named).

[⁠]()can, may

Use "can" to describe actions or conditions that are possible. Use "may" only to describe situations where permission is being given. If any of "can", "could", or "may" apply, use "can"; it is less tentative.

[⁠]()cannot

Correct, as one word, when used in the negative form. For example, "you cannot end a sentence with a preposition". Do not use "can not". When used as an additive, use two words. For example, "you can not only end a sentence with a preposition, but you can also start a sentence with a conjunction".

[⁠]()CapEx, OpEx

Correct. These stand for "capital expenditures" and "operating expenses" respectively. Do not use alternative capitalization.

[⁠]()cd, CD

When referring to the change directory command, use `cd`.

When referring to a compact disk, use "CD". For example, "Insert the CD into the CD drive". The plural is "CDs".

For more information, refer to the Word Usage section of [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** .

[⁠]()CD #1

When referring to a specific CD in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CD set, it is correct to refer to it as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux CD #1. Avoid using Red Hat Enterprise Linux CD 1.

[⁠]()Ceph

Correct. Ceph is a distributed storage platform that provides object, block, and file storage. [⁠]()[\[5\]](#ftn.id5198) Do not use alternative capitalization.

[⁠]()cgroup

Correct (all lowercase) when referring to the kernel-based technology. It is a contraction of control group, and not a proper noun in itself; proper nouns use initial caps. It is therefore permissible to capitalize it if used at the beginning of a sentence.

Where cgroup refers to something else, for example, a package name, file name, and so on, use a literal rendition.

[⁠]()characters

Do not use "characters" to mean "bytes". In English, bytes and characters can be used interchangeably; in other languages, a single character might consist of multiple bytes.

In computer software, a character is a symbol, such as a letter or number, that represents information. This includes all the ASCII and extended ASCII characters, including the space character. In character-based software, everything that appears on the screen, including graphics symbols, is considered to be a character. In graphics-based applications, the term character is generally reserved for letters, numbers, and punctuation.

[⁠]()chipset

*n.* One word. Do not use "chip set" or "chip-set".

[⁠]()CI/CD

Define on first use; generally continuous integration/continuous delivery. It does not mean continuous development, a term with questionable usefulness and only marginal adoption.

Refer also to [continuous integration (CI)](#continuous-integration), [continuous delivery (CD)](#continuous-delivery), [continuous deployment](#continuous-deployment).

[⁠]()ciphertext

*n.* One word. Do not use "cipher text", "cipher-text", or other variants.

[⁠]()click

*v.* Use when referring to a UI control button, for example, "Click **OK**." Do not use "click on".

For more information, refer to the Word Usage section of [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** .

[⁠]()client-side, client side

*adj.* Use the hyphenated form as an adjective. For example: "Winbind is a client-side service to connect to some Windows servers."

*n.* Use the two-word form as a noun. For example: "Winbind runs on the client side of a client/server Samba implementation."

[⁠]()clobber, clobbered

Avoid these and similar terms unless they are the actual name of something. Use "altered", "invalidated", or "overwritten", or whatever is appropriate in the context.

[⁠]()cloud

Although cloud is important to Red Hat's business, it is not a proper noun. Do not capitalize, unless it is part of a Red Hat product, service, solution, or business unit name. Use a lowercase "c" when referring to cloud or cloud computing in a general sense. Use a capitalized "C" when referring to the full name of official products, such as Red Hat CloudForms or Red Hat Cloud Foundations. Refer also to "big data".

[⁠]()cloudbursting

Define briefly on first use.

Refers to the event where a private cloud exceeds its capacity and "bursts" into and uses public cloud resources. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud deployment is that an organization pays only for extra computing resources when they are needed. [⁠]()[\[6\]](#ftn.id5262)

[⁠]()cloudwashing

Define briefly on first use.

Refers to the process of rebranding legacy products to include the term "cloud" to increase their appeal to the cloud market, even if such inclusion is not completely justified.

[⁠]()code

*n.* Use only as a noun, not a verb. Use "write" for a verb.

[⁠]()code base

*n.* Two words. Do not use "codebase", outside the specific context of codebase.com.

[⁠]()colocate, colocation

Write unhyphenated, to refer to people or services in the same location.

[⁠]()combo box

Do not use as an abbreviation for "combination box". For further usage information, refer to the relevant entry in [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** .

[⁠]()comma-delimited

*adj.* Correct (compound adjective). A data format in which each piece of data is separated by a comma. This is a popular format for transferring data from one application to another, because most database systems are able to import and export comma-delimited data.

[⁠]()comma-separated values (CSV)

Use this in preference to "comma-delimited values" whenever possible. The initialism CSV is widely used to denote information that is broken up through use of commas. This method is often used to share data between different, but similar applications, wherein the comma is a translator of the data.

[⁠]()command button

Use "button" instead.

[⁠]()command-driven

*adj.* Correct (compound adjective). Do not use "command driven" or "commanddriven".

Refers to programs and operating systems that accept commands in the form of special words or letters. In contrast, programs that provide a list of options in a menu are said to be *menu-driven*.

[⁠]()command language

*n.* The programming language through which a user communicates with the operating system or an application. For example, the DOS command language includes the commands DIR, COPY, and DEL, to name a few. The part of an operating system that responds to operating system commands is called the *command processor*.

With graphical user interfaces, the command language consists of operations that you perform with a mouse or similar input device.

[⁠]()command line, command-line, command prompt

Use "command line" to refer to the place where commands are entered. Use "command line" as a noun, and use "command-line" as an adjective.

For more details about how to use these terms, refer to the appropriate entries in [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** .

Refer also to [shell prompt](#shell-prompt) and to [terminal](#terminal).

[⁠]()commodity

Avoid using "commodity" when referring to hardware, including servers or storage, because it implies that the hardware is undifferentiated and might imply that it is cheap. Use instead:

- Volume
- Industry-standard

[⁠]()communication service provider (CSP)

Another way to refer to a telecommunications provider. Refer also to [telco](#telco).

[⁠]()container-based

Used to refer to more complex applications with multiple services that are distributed in containers. More common than "containerized".

[⁠]()containerized

Used to refer to an application or service that is distributed in a container or packed in a container.

[⁠]()Containers-as-a-Service

The term "Containers-as-a-Service" is owned by Docker and should be used only when referring to that company's offering. Refer also to [as-a-Service](#as-a-service).

[⁠]()continuous delivery (CD)

A software implementation architecture that ensures that all approved code can be easily pushed to production.

[⁠]()continuous deployment

A special case of continuous delivery, where approved code is automatically pushed to production. Do not use "CD" to refer to this practice.

[⁠]()continuous integration (CI)

A software development architecture where the developer code branch is synchronized with the main code branch multiple times per day. Development always works with the current code base.

[⁠]()control character

A special, non-printing character that begins, modifies, or ends a function, event, operation, or control operation. The ASCII character set defines 32 control characters. Originally, these codes were designed to control teletype machines. Now, however, they are often used to control display monitors, printers, and other modern devices.

[⁠]()control key

Use **Ctrl** instead, such as "To save the program, press **Ctrl**+**S**."

[⁠]()control program

A program that enhances an operating system by creating an environment in which you can run other programs. Control programs generally provide a graphical interface and enable you to run several programs at once in different windows.

Control programs are also called *operating environments*.

[⁠]()cookie

*n.* Data that is given to a web browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file that might be named `cookie.txt`. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

[⁠]()CR

Use if referring to code, such as "Type CR at the end of each line ...". If referring to the keyboard key, use either **Enter** or **Return**, depending on the platform.

[⁠]()crash

IBM recommends the use of "fail" rather than "crash". Use the latter only if you can justify why "fail" is inadequate.

[⁠]()cross-platform

*adj.* Hyphenate. Do not use "crossplatform" or "cross platform".

Refers to the capability of software or hardware to run identically on different platforms.

[⁠]()cross-site scripting

Correct. When referring to cross-site scripting attacks, use "cross-site scripting attack". Acceptable use is also "cross-site scripting (XSS) attack".

[⁠]()CVE

*n.* CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, and should be capitalized as shown. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common\_Vulnerabilities\_and\_Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) for more information.

[⁠]()Cygmon

Correct. Do not use "CygMon", "cygmon", or "CYGMON". An exception is if a command is being typed (such as `cygmon`).

Refer to it as "Cygmon: a ROM monitor", not "Cygmon: the Cygnus ROM monitor", or "Cygmon: the ROM monitor".

[⁠]()data center, datacenter

*n.* Use the two-word form unless referring to a product name or other proper noun where the one-word form is used.

[⁠]()data mirroring

The act of copying data from one location to a storage device in real time. Because the data is copied in real time, the information that is stored from the original location is always an exact copy of the data from the production device. Data mirroring is useful in the speedy recovery of critical data after a disaster. Data mirroring can be implemented locally or offsite at a different location.

[⁠]()data sheet, datasheet

*n.* Use the two-word form.

[⁠]()data source

*n.* Use the two-word form unless referring to a proper noun, argument, variable, or other case where the one-word form is required.

[⁠]()desktop

Correct. Do not use "desk top" or "desk-top".

[⁠]()device

Any machine or component that attaches to a computer. Examples of devices include disk drives, printers, mice, and modems. These particular devices fall into the category of peripheral devices because they are separate from the main computer.

Most devices, whether peripheral or not, require a program called a *device driver* that acts as a translator, converting general commands from an application into specific commands that the device understands.

[⁠]()DevOps

*n., adj.* A portmanteau that combines "development" and "operations". It refers to a specific method or organizational approach where developers and IT operations work together to create the applications that run the business.

[⁠]()dialog box

*n.* Use "dialog box" (*not* "dialog", "dialogue", or "dialogue box"), to refer to an element that is displayed for a user to interact with a graphical user interface.

Use this term regardless of whether a dialog box is *modal*, where the user must respond to a prompt before the main content of the interface is enabled again, or is *non-modal*, where the user can continue interacting with the main content when the dialog box is open.

For example: "In the **Subscriptions** window, click **Register** to open the **Register System** dialog box."

[⁠]()different

Use "different from" rather than "different than" when the next part of the sentence is a noun or pronoun (that is, two things are being compared). For example: "Form 123 is different from Form 124."

[⁠]()digital transformation

Avoid this phrase. It is vague and could mean use of digital technology to do something faster, to do something differently, or to do something new. The word "transform" implies a process with a beginning and an end. Some people use the phrase "digital leadership" to describe the ongoing adoption of digital technologies to advance their organization. If you must discuss the concepts of digital transformation or digital leadership, briefly define what you mean on the first occurrence. Describe, rather than label.

[⁠]()disk, disc

[⁠]()e.g.

Red Hat technical documentation always expands these abbreviations. Write out "for example".

[⁠]()Emacs

If referring to the program, use "Emacs". For example, "Source-Navigator supports Emacs or vi commands". If referring to the shell prompt command, use "emacs". For example, "At the prompt, type `emacs`." The complete and correct name is "GNU Emacs".

[⁠]()enter

When referring to the keyboard key, use **Enter**. If referring to the keyboard key on Solaris, use **Return**.

When referring to typing a command, use "type" instead, such as "To open Source-Navigator from the command line, type `snavigator`."

When typing information into a single-field dialog box, "enter" means "type and press **Enter**". An example is "enter the license number". For multi-field dialog boxes, refer to "type".

[⁠]()environment

The state of a computer, usually determined by which programs are running and basic hardware and software characteristics. For example, running a program in a UNIX environment means running a program on a computer that has the UNIX operating system.

One ingredient of an environment, therefore, is the operating system. But operating systems include many different parameters. For example, in some operating systems, you can choose your command prompt or a default command path. All these parameters together constitute the environment.

Another term for *environment* in this sense is *platform*.

[⁠]()execute

Has the same meaning as *run*. Execute means to perform an action, as in executing a program or a command.

[⁠]()Exif

Correct. Do not use "EXIF". Exif is an image file format specification that enables adding metadata tags to existing JPEG, TIFF, and RIFF files. Sometimes referred to as "Exif Print".

[⁠]()extranet

Refers to an intranet that is partially accessible to authorized outsiders. Whereas an intranet resides behind a firewall and is accessible only to members of the same company or organization, an extranet provides various levels of accessibility to outsiders. You can access an extranet only if you have a valid username and password, and your identity determines which parts of the extranet you can view.

Capitalize only at the beginning of a sentence.

A fully qualified domain name consists of a list of domain labels representing the hierarchy from the lowest relevant level in the DNS to the top-level domain (TLD). The domain labels are concatenated by using the dot or period character (.) as a separator between labels. [⁠]()[\[7\]](#ftn.id5790)

For example, `www.redhat.com` is a fully qualified domain name, where "www" is the host, "redhat" is the second-level domain, and "com" is the top-level domain.

An FQDN always starts with a hostname and continues all the way up to the top-level domain name; consequently "www.parc.xerox.com" is also an FQDN.

[⁠]()frictionless

Avoid. This term is both jargon and inaccurate. Nothing is ever really frictionless. Instead, talk about actual improvement in speed or time. Refer also to [bimodal IT](#bimodal-it).

[⁠]()front end, front-end

*n.* Two words. For example, "PRCS is a front end for a version control toolset."

*adj.* Hyphenate. For example, "This chapter explains how to use the front-end API functions."

[⁠]()I/O

Correct. Stands for input/output (pronounced "eye-oh"). The term "I/O" is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mice are input-only devices; devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD is both an input and an output device.

The term "I/O" is a non-countable noun. Append "operations" to refer to multiple units of I/O. For example: I/O operations could not be recovered in situations where I/O should have been temporarily queued, such as when paths were unavailable.

[⁠]()IOPS

Correct. All caps. Stands for input/output operations per second.

[⁠]()IP

Correct. Stands for Internet Protocol. Capitalize both letters.

[⁠]()IP Masquerade

A Linux networking function. IP Masquerade, also called IPMASQ or MASQ, allows one or more computers in a network without assigned IP addresses to communicate with the internet by using the Linux server's assigned IP address. The IPMASQ server acts as a gateway, and the other devices are invisible behind it, so to other machines on the internet the outgoing traffic appears to be coming from the IPMASQ server and not from the internal PCs.

Because IPMASQ is a generic technology, the server can be connected to other computers through LAN technologies such as Ethernet, Token-Ring, and FDDI, as well as dial-up connections such as PPP or SLIP.

[⁠]()IPsec

IPsec stands for Internet Protocol security. According to its RFC, IPsec should be used. Do not use "IPSec".

[⁠]()IP switching

A type of IP routing that Ipsilon Networks, Inc. developed. Unlike conventional routers, IP switching routers use ATM hardware to speed packets through networks. This type of IP routing appears to be considerably faster than previous router techniques.

[⁠]()ISV

Short for "independent software vendor", a company that produces software.

[⁠]()IT/I.T.

Use "I.T." (with periods) only in headlines or subheadings where all caps are used, to clarify that the word is "IT" versus "it".

[⁠]()Itanium

A member of Intel's Merced family of processors, Itanium is a 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Based on the EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) design philosophy, which states that the compiler should decide which instructions should be executed together, Itanium has the highest FPU power available.

In 64-bit mode, Itanium can calculate two bundles of a maximum of three instructions at a time. In 32-bit mode, it is much slower. Decoders must first translate 32-bit instruction sets into 64-bit instruction sets, which results in extra-clock cycle use.

Itanium's primary use is driving large applications that require more than 4 GB of memory, such as databases, ERP, and future internet applications.

Do not use the term "IA64". It can be used in file names because they are not printed in the content.

[⁠]()Itanium 2

Itanium 2 is correct. Do not use "Itanium2" and always use a non-breaking space between "Itanium" and "2".

## [⁠]()Chapter 18. J

[⁠]()JavaScript

"JavaScript" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation, and should be used when referring to the scripting language. When referring to a file that is written with this language, use all lowercase; for example, "...copy the IPA javascript file to the `/temp` directory".

[⁠]()JBoss Community

No longer referred to as "JBoss.org". Use when referring to the community of users and contributors.

[⁠]()job

A task that a computer system performs. For example, printing a file is a job. Jobs can be performed by a single program or by a collection of programs.

[⁠]()jsvc

The Apache Commons Daemon jsvc is a set of libraries and applications to run Java applications on UNIX more easily. At the beginning of a sentence, use "Jsvc", otherwise all lowercase.

[⁠]()just

Use sparingly. In the phrase, "Just open the file ...", omit the word "just".

[⁠]()JVM

Initialism for Java Virtual Machine, and a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation. Due to this registration, rather than using "JVM" as a noun when referring to the virtual machine, use the full phrase "Java Virtual Machine", or "Java VM", or only the noun itself, "virtual machine". You can include "JVM" for clarity, because most people know it as such, for example, "Java Virtual Machine (JVM)". Do not use Jvm or jvm.

## [⁠]()Chapter 19. K

[⁠]()KB, kB

For the correct abbreviation to use for specific use cases, refer to [*Units of Measurement*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=measurement-units) in *IBM Style* **![](images/padlock.png)** .

[⁠]()kbps, KBps, kBps

kbps is the accepted abbreviation for kilobit per second, or 1000 bits per second.

KBps and kBps are accepted abbreviations for kilobyte per second, or 1000 bytes per second.

[⁠]()kerberize

Incorrect. Do not use "kerberize", "kerberized", or other variants to refer to applications or services that use Kerberos authentication. Refer to such applications as "Kerberos-aware" or "Kerberos-enabled", or rewrite the sentence.

[⁠]()kernel

The central module of an operating system. It is the part of the operating system that loads first, and it remains in main memory. Because it stays in memory, it is important for the kernel to be as small as possible but still provide all the essential services that other parts of the operating system and applications require. Typically, the kernel is responsible for memory management, process and task management, and disk management.

[⁠]()Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)

Spell out on first use, capitalized. Use the initialism (KVM) thereafter. It is an industry standard, and a proper noun.

[⁠]()kernel panic

Correct. Many different circumstances might cause a kernel panic, but unlike a kernel oops, when confronted with a kernel panic the operating system shuts down to prevent the possibility of further damage or security breaches.

[⁠]()kernel space, kernel-space

*n.* Two words when used as a noun.

*adj.* Hyphenate as an adjective, "kernel-space". Do not use "kernelspace".

[⁠]()keyboard key

When referring to a keyboard key, it is uppercase, singular, and the word "key" is not necessary, such as "To exit, press X". When the **Ctrl** or **Alt** keys are needed, use a plus sign between the keys, such as "To save the file, press "Ctrl+S".

Refer also to [Spacebar](#spacebar).

[⁠]()key ring

*n.* Use the two-word form as a noun. For example, "Verify that the Ceph client key ring is present in the `/etc/ceph` directory on the client node", or "add your new key to the key ring".

*adj.* Use the hyphenated form as an adjective. For example, "copy the key-ring file to the server".

Only use the one-word form, "keyring", if it is the actual name of a command, package, or other proper noun.

[⁠]()keytab

*n.* *(Kerberos)* Correct. A keytab (short for "key table") stores long-term keys for one or more principals. For details, refer to [https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab\_def.html](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab_def.html).

[⁠]()key-value

*adj.* Correct when referring to a data representation in computing systems and applications, for example a "key-value pair". Do not use "key/value" or any other variations.

[⁠]()Kickstart

*adj.* A network installation system for some Linux distributions. [⁠]()[\[9\]](#ftn.id6359)

[⁠]()kill

If terminating a UNIX process, use "kill". For example, to terminate the process, type `kill <PID>`. If terminating a Windows process, use "terminate". For example, "To terminate the process, press **Q**."

[⁠]()knowledge base

Correct. Use the two-word form unless referring specifically to the "Red Hat Knowledgebase". In this case, use the one-word form and capitalize the "K". Do not capitalize the "b".

* * *

[\[9\]](#id6359) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart (Linux)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_%28Linux%29)

## [⁠]()Chapter 20. L

[⁠]()LAN

Correct. This is an acronym for Local Area Network. Do not use Lan or lan.

[⁠]()latency

- In general, the period of time that one component in a system is spinning its wheels waiting for another component. Latency, therefore, is wasted time. For example, in accessing data on a disk, latency is defined as the time it takes to position the proper sector under the read/write head.
- In networking, the amount of time it takes a packet to travel from source to destination. Together, latency and bandwidth define the speed and capacity of a network.

[⁠]()later

Use to refer to later or more recent releases of products. Do not use "newer" or related terms. Refer also to [earlier](#earlier).

[⁠]()leave out

Do not use. Use "omit" instead.

[⁠]()left-click

*v.* Write the term hyphenated. Do not use "left click" or "leftclick".

[⁠]()LibreOffice

A Linux desktop suite. Do not use "Libre", "Libreoffice", or "Libre Office".

Refer also to [OpenOffice](#openoffice)

[⁠]()license

*n., v.* Use this form for both the noun and the verb.

[⁠]()lifecycle

*n., adj.* Write as one word, except to refer to an approved product name that includes that term written as two words.

[⁠]()like

Avoid "like" to mean "such as". For example, instead of "Namespaces can include resources like network interfaces", use "Namespaces can include resources such as network interfaces".

[⁠]()Linux

Correct. Do not use "LINUX" or "linux" unless referring to a command, such as "To start Linux, type `linux`."

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds. Use a registered trademark symbol on first use.

[⁠]()load

- To copy a program from a storage device into memory. Every program must be loaded into memory before it can be executed. Usually the loading process is performed invisibly by a part of the operating system called the *loader*.
- *v.* In programming, "to load" means to move from one storage type to another storage type for use.
- *n.* The measurement of how any finite resource is being used. For example, the amount of data (traffic) that the network carries, or the amount of CPU in use at any given time.

[⁠]()load balancing

Distributing processing and communications activity evenly across a computer network so that no single device is overwhelmed. Load balancing is especially important for networks where it is difficult to predict the number of requests that are issued to a server. Busy websites typically use two or more web servers in a load balancing scheme. If one server starts to get swamped, requests are forwarded to another server with more capacity. Load balancing can also refer to the communications channels themselves.

[⁠]()logical topology

Also called signal topology. Every LAN has a topology, which refers to the way that the devices on a network are arranged and how they communicate with each other. The physical topology is the way that the workstations are connected to the network through the cables that transmit data: the physical structure of the network. The logical topology, in contrast, is the way that the signals act on the network media, or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices.

[⁠]()login, log in

Write as one word as an adjective or noun, or as two words as a verb.

- *adj., n.* One word. For example, "the login credentials".
- *v.* Two words. For example, "to log in as the root user".

In general, use "log in" when referring to Linux-based technologies and platforms. In some cases, a tool or platform might use "sign in" or other terms to describe starting a session by entering a username and password. In these cases, align to the terminology that is used in the user interface.

Refer also to [sign-in, sign in](#sign-in) and [sign-on, sign on](#sign-on).

[⁠]()log in to

*v.* Write as three words. For example, "to log in to the system".

[⁠]()log out of

*v.* Write as three words. Use "log out of", not "log out from". For example, "to log out of the system".

[⁠]()look at

Do not use. Use "examine" or "inspect" or some other more precise term instead.

[⁠]()lookup, look up

*n., adj.* Use the one-word form, unhyphenated.

*v.* Use the two-word form.

[⁠]()loopback address

The loopback address is a special IP address (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6) that is designated for the software loopback interface of a machine. No hardware is associated with a loopback interface, and it is not physically connected to a network.

With a loopback interface, IT professionals can test IP software without concern for broken or corrupted drivers or hardware.

[⁠]()lots of

Do not use. Use "many" instead.

[⁠]()LPAR

Abbreviation of "logical partitioning", a system of taking a computer's total resources, such as processors, memory, and storage, and splitting them into smaller units that can be run with their own instance of the operating system and applications. Logical partitioning, which requires specialized hardware circuits, is typically used to separate different functions of a system, such as web serving, database functions, client/server actions, or systems that serve multiple time zones or languages. Logical partitioning can also keep testing environments separated from production environments. Because the partitions act as separate physical machines, they can communicate with each other. Logical partitioning was first used in 1976 by IBM.

## [⁠]()Chapter 21. M

[⁠]()macOS

In 2016, Apple rebranded OS X to macOS, adopting the nomenclature that it uses for their other operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

[⁠]()make sure

This means "be careful to remember, attend to, or find out something". For example, "make sure that the rhedk group is listed in the output."

You might be able to use "verify" or "ensure" instead.

[⁠]()manual, man page

Correct. Two words. Do not use "manpage".

[⁠]()master

Do not use "master" when it is paired with "slave". Such use diminishes the horror of the dehumanizing practice of slavery. Use another term such as "main", "primary", "controller", or "leader".

Use of "master" is acceptable in other contexts, such as to refer to mastery of a skill.

[⁠]()matrixes

Correct. This is the correct plural form for US English spelling. Do not use "matrices".

[⁠]()MB

- When written as MB, stands for megabyte (1,000,000 or 1,048,576 bytes, depending on the context).
- When written as Mb, stands for megabit.

[⁠]()MBps

Initialism for megabytes per second, a measure of data transfer speed. Mass storage devices are generally measured in MBps.

[⁠]()MBR

Initialism for Master Boot Record, a small program that is executed when a computer boots up. Typically, the MBR resides on the first sector of the hard disk. The program begins the boot process by looking up the partition table to determine which partition to use for booting. It then transfers program control to the boot sector of that partition, which continues the boot process. In DOS and Windows systems, you can create the MBR with the FDISK /MBR command.

[⁠]()MDOS

Correct. Do not use "ms-dos", "MSDOS", or "msdos".

[⁠]()media

- Objects on which data can be stored. These include hard disks, CDs, and tapes.
- In computer networks, "media" refers to the cables that link workstations together. Out of many types of transmission media, the most popular are twisted-pair wire (normal electrical wire), coaxial cable (the type of cable used for cable television), and fiber optic cable (cables made out of glass).
- The form and technology to communicate information. Multimedia presentations, for example, combine sound, pictures, and videos, which are all different types of media.

[⁠]()menu-driven

*adj.* Correct. Do not use "menu driven" or "menudriven".

Refers to programs whose user interface employs menus. The antithesis of a menu-driven program is a command-driven program.

[⁠]()message

*n.* Write "the system displays a message" or "send an instant message".

*adj.* For example, "A messaging system".

Do not use as a verb.

[⁠]()metadata

Correct. Do not use "meta data" or "meta-data".

[⁠]()microservice

*n.* Correct. One word, common noun. Do not use "micro-service" or "micro service". Only capitalize at the beginning of a sentence or in a title. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) for a definition.

[⁠]()Microsoft

Correct. Do not use "MS", "MSFT", or "MicroSoft".

[⁠]()misconfigure

*v.* This term is in common use and does appear in some dictionaries, but try to avoid it if possible. Do not hyphenate.

[⁠]()mission-critical

*adj.* Write as shown.

Use to refer to software or systems that are essential to fulfilling the core purpose of an organization. When mission-critical systems fail, the impact is often immediate and always severe. Mission-critical software can include customer-facing software for ensuring safety and regulatory compliance and core back-end systems, such as databases and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

To continue to accomplish its core mission, Red Hat considers software to be mission-critical if it is essential to preventing major loss or sustaining health and safety, data or software security, or regulatory compliance.

Examples of failures that are not considered as mission-critical include an outage for routine maintenance, or a system that is down but is not directly affecting customers.

[⁠]()Montecito

Do not use. It is a code name for the "Intel Itanium Processor 9000 Sequence". This latter phrase should be used instead.

[⁠]()mount

*v.*

1. To make a mass storage device available. For example, inserting a USB flash drive is called mounting the drive.
2. To install a device, such as a disk drive or expansion board.

[⁠]()mouse button

*n.* Two words. Do not use "mouse-button" or "mousebutton". If you need to indicate which mouse button, use "right", "left", or "center", such as "right mouse button". Do not hyphenate.

[⁠]()Mozilla Firefox

Correct. The first reference must be "Mozilla Firefox". Any following references can be "Firefox".

[⁠]()Mozilla Thunderbird

Correct. The first reference must be "Mozilla Thunderbird". Any following references can be "Thunderbird".

[⁠]()multiprocessing

Correct. Do not use "multi-processing".

[⁠]()must

Use when referring to a task that a user is required to do. For example, "You must make a backup" is a requirement, but "You should make a backup" is a suggestion.

[⁠]()mutexes

Correct. "Mutex" is an abbreviation of "mutual exclusion". Consequently, "mutexes" is the correct plural form.

[⁠]()MySQL

Common open source database server and client package. Do not use "MYSQL" or "mySQL". Mark the first mention of MySQL in body text with an ® symbol to denote a registered trademark.

## [⁠]()Chapter 22. N

[⁠]()named

When referring to the designation of files, objects, or entities within documentation, use the term "named" instead of "called". This choice promotes clarity and precision in technical content. The word "named" directly associates the name with the entity and is more specific in technical contexts. Use "named" to refer to such items as a file, directory, task, user, or group. For example, "When you need to store configuration settings, create a directory named `configurations` to keep your workspace organized."

On the other hand, "called" can imply a more casual or informal reference and might introduce ambiguity, because it can also mean "invoked" in the context of functions or methods.

Refer also to [call, called](#called).

[⁠]()navigate to

Use "go to", in preference to "navigate to", for directing readers to a location, including when moving through multiple UI options, to cover all cases where you might have to click, point to, select, or otherwise make a series of selections to initiate an action. For example, "Go to the student user's home directory." It is acceptable to use the noun form, "navigation", for example "navigation through the interface".

Refer to [go to](#go-to).

[⁠]()needs, needs to be, need to

Avoid when possible. Use "must" or "required" or similar.

[⁠]().NET

The Microsoft .NET Framework is a software framework for Microsoft Windows operating systems. It includes a large library, and supports several programming languages.

"Microsoft .NET" is correct for the first reference, and ".NET" for all following references.

[⁠]()network transparency

A condition in which an operating system or other service gives user access to a remote resource through a network without needing to know if the resource is remote or local. For example, Sun Microsystems NFS, now a de facto industry standard, provides access to shared files through the Virtual File System (VFS) interface that runs on top of the TCP/IP stack. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk.

[⁠]()NFS

Abbreviation of Network File System, a client/server application designed by Sun Microsystems that provides access for all network users to shared files stored on computers of different types. NFS provides access to shared files through the Virtual File System (VFS) interface that runs in a layer above TCP/IP. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk.

With NFS, computers that are connected to a network operate as clients while accessing remote files, and as servers while providing remote users access to local shared files. The NFS standards are publicly available and widely used.

[⁠]()node

1. In networks, a processing location. A node can be a computer or some other device such as a printer. Every node has a unique network address, sometimes called a Data Link Control (DLC) address or a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
2. In tree structures, a point where two or more lines meet.

[⁠]()nonsecure

Do not use. Use "insecure" instead.

[⁠]()NULL or null

When a command or value is stated, use NULL. When stating that something is null, use "null", all lowercase.

[⁠]()number sign

Generally, use "number sign" to refer to the # character. Otherwise, use "hash" to refer to a hashtag in social media, or to refer to Secure Hash Algorithm (refer to [SHA-1, SHA-2](#sha)), or when writing exclusively for a European audience. You can instead use "pound sign" when writing exclusively for a North American audience, if "number sign" is not appropriate for the context.

## [⁠]()Chapter 23. O

[⁠]()Objective C

Correct. Do not use "Objective-C".

[⁠]()object-oriented

Correct. Do not use "object oriented", "objectoriented", or "object-orientated". It is a modifier, such as "Java is an object-oriented language".

[⁠]()OEM

*n.* Stands for *original equipment manufacturer*, which is a misleading term for a company that has a special relationship with computer producers. OEMs buy computers in bulk and customize them for a particular application. They then sell the customized computer under their own name. The term is a misnomer because OEMs are not the original manufacturers; they are the customizers.

[⁠]()offline

*adj.* Write as one word. Do not use "off-line".

[⁠]()offline backup

Correct. Use this term to refer to backing up a database while the database is not being accessed by applications. Do not use "cold backup" or any other variations.

The counterpart to this term is "online backup", to refer to the process of backing up a database while it is being accessed by other applications. Do not use "hot backup" or any other variations.

[⁠]()OK

When referring to the **OK** button, it is not necessary to use "button" in the sentence. For example, "Click **OK** to close the dialog box."

Use "OK" only to refer to an interface element, not in general text. For example, instead of using "It is OK to run the command", use alternative wording, such as "You can run the command".

[⁠]()onboard

*adj, tr.v.* Use the one-word form in all cases.

[⁠]()once

Use only to mean "one time". Do not use as a conjunction to mean "after" or "when".

Example 1: Instead of "Once the name is set for a network interface on the system, the name of the interface does not change", use "When the name is set for a network interface on the system, the name of the interface does not change".

Example 2: Instead of "Once you generate the SSH keys, you can find them by default in the `.ssh/` directory", use "After you generate the SSH keys, you can find them by default in the `.ssh/` directory".

[⁠]()online

*adj.* Write as one word. Do not use "on-line".

[⁠]()on premise, on-premise

*adverb* Two words.

*adj.* Hyphenate if used as an adjective before a noun. Otherwise, use the two-word form.

[⁠]()on premises, on-premises

Do not use. Refer to [on premise, on-premise](#onpremise).

[⁠]()on-site

*adj.* Hyphenate when used as an adjective, as in "on-site labs".

[⁠]()on-the-fly

Do not use. Avoid idioms, which might not be globally known. In this case, for example, "real time" is both non-idiomatic and more technically accurate.

[⁠]()oops

A kernel oops is an error message that is generated because of a bug in the kernel. Do not use "oops" on its own. Also, avoid using "kernel oops" at the beginning of a sentence. Refer also to "kernel panic".

[⁠]()opcodes

Correct. Do not use "op-codes".

[⁠]()open architecture

An architecture whose specifications are public. It includes officially approved standards as well as privately designed architectures whose specifications are made public by the designers. The opposite of open is closed or proprietary.

[⁠]()Open InfiniBand

"Open InfiniBand" is deprecated and should not be used. Refer to "InfiniBand" for usage rules regarding the current preferred term for this switched fabric network topology.

OpenJDK

The OpenJDK trademark is owned by Oracle with a fair-use clause, so be careful about how you use this term.

[⁠]()OpenOffice

A Linux desktop suite. Do not use "Openoffice", "Open Office", or "ooo".

Refer also to [LibreOffice](#libreoffice).

[⁠]()open source

Correct. Do not use "OpenSource", "opensource", or "open-source". Only capitalize the "o" in "open source" at the beginning of a sentence.

[⁠]()open source way

A phrase that was coined by the Red Hat community and adopted by opensource.com in 2009. It is a reference to an "open source method", as in "The team developed this project the open source way."

Do not use to suggest that something is being done only in the "spirit" of open source without having an open source policy as defined by [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/osd), to avoid diluting the legal meaning of the term "open source".

[⁠]()operating system

Correct. Do not use Operating System, or OS.

[⁠]()orientate

Do not use. A user becomes "oriented" to an environment. Try a synonym such as "familiarize", as in "This section helps to familiarize you with the environment."

[⁠]()OTP

*n.* OTP stands for "one-time password". Always use lowercase for the phrase itself. Do not use any other variations.

[⁠]()output device

Any machine that is capable of representing information from a computer, including display screens, printers, plotters, and synthesizers.

[⁠]()overcloud

*n.* Always lowercase. This is a concept, not a technology or product name. Being a common noun, it normally requires an article. Refer also to [undercloud](#undercloud).

[⁠]()override

Correct. Do not use "over-ride" or "over ride".

## [⁠]()Chapter 24. P

[⁠]()PaaS

*n.* The correct abbreviation for "Platform-as-a-Service". In the spelled-out version of this term and its variants (for example, Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service), always use hyphens.

Refer also to [SaaS](#saas).

[⁠]()PC

*n.* Use to refer to a personal computer.

persist

*v.* Do not use as a verb to mean "store" or "save", for example, when referring to persistent storage.

[⁠]()PHP

*n.* Use PHP when referring to the language in general. Use `php` when referring to the specific command or some other literal use.

Refer to [http://www.php.net/](http://www.php.net/) for specific PHP language information. Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) for more general information.

[⁠]()Pico, pico

*n, adj.* Capitalize when referring to the text editor or to the programming language. Do not capitalize when referring to the SI prefix.

[⁠]()plain text

*n.* Two words. In most cases, do not use "plaintext", "cleartext", or other variants.

Cryptographers distinguish between "cleartext" (unencrypted data) and "plaintext" (unencrypted data as input to an encryption algorithm). Red Hat uses "plain text" as a plain English denotation of all unencrypted information, whether it is stored or being fed to an encryption algorithm. Unless it is necessary to make the cryptographer's distinction, do not use "plaintext" or "cleartext".

[⁠]()please

Do not use. Instead of saying "Please refer to the *Getting Started Guide*", use "Refer to the *Getting Started Guide."*

Technical information requires an authoritative tone; terms of politeness convey the wrong tone for technical information and are not regarded the same way in all cultures.

[⁠]()pluggable

*adj.* Something that is capable of being plugged in, especially in terms of (for example) software modules. "Hot-pluggable" is also widely used with respect to hardware to indicate that it can be connected and recognized without powering down the system.

[⁠]()plug-in

*n.* Write hyphenated. Do not use "plugin".

A hardware or software module that adds a specific feature or service to a larger system.

[⁠]()PM

For times of day, use uppercase without periods, and use a preceding nonbreaking space after the numeral, for example "2 PM".

[⁠]()POSIX

*n.* Do not use "Posix", "posix", or variations thereof.

An acronym for "Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX".

[⁠]()PostScript

*n.* It is a registered trademark of Adobe. Do not use "Postscript".

[⁠]()PowerPC

*n.* The name of the Power architecture is "Power", but the designation of individual chips tends to be either "PowerPC" or "POWER". Refer to IBM marketing or the [Open Power Foundation](http://openpowerfoundation.org) if unsure.

Do not use the "PPC64" or "ppc64le" shorthand. Depending on context, either "64-bit PowerPC" (which covers most 64-bit PowerPC implementations) or "64-bit IBM Power Series" (which covers the IBM POWER2 and IBM POWER8 and POWER9 series) is correct. Additional application binary interface (ABI) features are important, but are not officially part of the Power architecture name, so use them as descriptors, such as "64-bit IBM Power Series in little-endian mode".

Note: The PowerPC version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux runs on 64-bit IBM Power Series hardware in most cases.

[⁠]()PPP

*n.* Do not use "ppp" or "Ppp".

An initialism for Point-to-Point Protocol.

[⁠]()press

*v.* Use for keyboard instructions. For example: "Press the **Enter** key" or more succinctly "Press **Enter**."

[⁠]()print queue

*n.* Use "print queue", not "printer queue", to refer to a list of print jobs that are sent to a printer.

[⁠]()proof of concept

Use the following rules to form the plural of this phrase:

- Use "proofs of concept" for multiple proofs and only one concept.
- Use "proofs of concepts" for multiple proofs and multiple concepts.
- Do not use "proof of concepts".

[⁠]()pseudo-ops

Correct. Do not use "pseudo ops" or "pseudoops".

[⁠]()pull-down

*adj.* Use only if you must specify the type of menu or list. Do not use "pulldown".

push-button automation, turn-key automation

Metaphorical language (literally, push a button or turn a key to begin automation), and difficult to translate. Often used to refer to easy or hands-off automation, but human intervention is required, so this use is not accurate. Instead, use accurate language for the situation, such as:

- User-triggered automation
- Ready-to-use, ready-to-deploy
- Self-service, self-provisioned.
- Single-step automation
- On-demand automation

[⁠]()PXE

Short for Pre-Boot Execution Environment. Pronounced "pixie", PXE is one of the components of Intel's Wired for Management (WfM) specification. With PXE, a workstation can boot from a server on a network in preference to booting the operating system on the local hard drive.

PXE is a mandatory element of the WfM specification. To be considered compliant, PXE must be supported by the computer's BIOS and its NIC.

## [⁠]()Chapter 25. Q

[⁠]()qeth

Always lowercase.

[⁠]()quiesce, quiescent

Use with caution. This term is readily understood in the context of databases and stateful systems, but in other contexts another term might be more suitable.

## [⁠]()Chapter 26. R

[⁠]()RAM

Correct. Do not use "Ram" or any other variations. It is an acronym for "random access memory".

[⁠]()RAM disk

Correct. Do not use "RAMdisk", "ramdisk", or "RAdisk".

Refers to RAM that is configured to simulate a disk drive. You can access files on a RAM disk as you would access files on a real disk. RAM disks, however, are about a thousand times faster than hard disk drives. They are particularly useful, therefore, for applications that require frequent disk accesses.

[⁠]()raw

Unprocessed. The term refers to data that is passed to an I/O device without being interpreted. In contrast, cooked refers to data that is processed before being passed to the I/O device.

The term can also refer to information that is not organized, formatted, or analyzed.

Whereas remote control refers to taking control of another computer, remote access means that the remote computer becomes a full-fledged host on the network. The remote access software dials in directly to the network server. The only difference between a remote host and workstations that are connected directly to the network is slower data transfer speeds.

For references within a document, and for cross-references to other resources, do not use “see”. Use “refer to”.

For descriptions of graphics, explanations of command outputs, and other similar cases, it is acceptable to use “see”. Alternatively, it might be more concise or precise to replace “see” with another verb in these cases. For example, instead of using "Click a server link to see the result details", you could use "Click a server link for the result details". Instead of using "As you can see, these expected Audit events have an AVC Audit record", you could use "As shown in the output, these expected Audit events have an AVC Audit record".

A server farm streamlines internal processes by distributing the workload between the individual components of the farm and expedites computing processes by harnessing the power of multiple servers. The farms rely on load-balancing software that accomplishes such tasks as tracking demand for processing power from different machines, prioritizing the tasks, and scheduling and rescheduling them depending on priority and demand that users put on the network. When one server in the farm fails, another can step in as a backup.

[⁠]()server-side/server side

Refer to [client-side, client side](#client-side).

[⁠]()setup

Use "setup" as a noun or an adjective, and "set up" as a verb. For example:

[⁠]()SHA-1, SHA-2

Pronounced "shä" and thus requires "an" as the indefinite article.

SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm; each is a cryptographic hash function. SHA2 variants are often specified by using their digest size, in bits, as the trailing number, instead of "2". Thus "SHA224", "SHA256", "SHA384", and "SHA512" are considered correct when referring to these specific hash functions.

Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure\_Hash\_Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) for full details.

These systems use encryption and other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the network and that the data cannot be intercepted.

## [⁠]()Chapter 31. W

[⁠]()WAN

A computer network that spans a relatively large geographical area. Typically, a WAN consists of two or more local-area networks (LANs).

Computers connected to a wide-area network are often connected through public networks, such as the telephone system. They can also be connected through leased lines or satellites. The largest WAN in existence is the internet.

[⁠]()want

Use instead of "wish" or "would like". Rephrase to avoid whenever possible. For example, "If you want to use the debugger, ..." can be rewritten as "To use the debugger, ...".

[⁠]()WCA

An abbreviation of "web clipping application", to extract static information from a web server and load that data onto a web-enabled personal digital assistant (PDA).

WCAs are also called "query applications".

[⁠]()webhook

*n.* One word. Common noun. Capitalize only at the beginning of a sentence. Use alternative capitalization only if it appears as a proper noun.

[⁠]()web page

*n.* Two words. Capitalize the "W" at the beginning of a sentence. If part of a proper noun, capitalize accordingly.

[⁠]()web UI

Correct. Use this term to refer to a browser-based interface to a software application, even if that application has no connection to the web. Do not hyphenate the abbreviation or use the one-word form.

[⁠]()we suggest

Do not use. Use a more direct construction, or use "recommend". For example, instead of "We suggest that you make a backup of your data disk", write "Back up your data disk".

[⁠]()whether

Use "whether" instead of "if" to refer to a choice or to alternatives. For example, instead of "Test if authenticated FTP access is restored", write "Test whether authenticated FTP access is restored".

[⁠]()while

In technical content, use "while" only to indicate that many tasks or processes occur at the same time. For example, instead of "While most targets use one target portal group (TPG), advanced configurations might define multiple TPGs", write "Although most targets use one target portal group (TPG), advanced configurations might define multiple TPGs."

[⁠]()whitelist

Do not use. Use "allowlist".

Do not use the terms "white" or "black" in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad. Such usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.

[⁠]()who, whom

Use the pronoun "who" as a subject. Use the pronoun "whom" as a direct object, an indirect object, or the object of a preposition.

For example: Who owns this phone? To whom does this phone belong?

[⁠]()will

Do not use future tense unless it is absolutely necessary. For example, do not write "The next section will describe the process in detail." Instead, write "The next section describes the process in detail."

[⁠]()Window Maker

Correct. Do not combine into one word or hyphenate. This is a window manager for the X Window System.

[⁠]()wish

Use "want" instead of "wish" when the reader's actions are optional (that is, they might not "need" something but might still "want" something).

## [⁠]()Chapter 32. XYZ

[⁠]()X

An alternative reference to the "X Window System." Do not use X by itself when referring to "XEmacs."

[⁠]()x86\_64

*n.* A 64-bit version of the x86 architecture. Use this term when referring to operating systems and server instances, for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CoreOS and other Linux distributions. Use this format without backticks in general cases when referring to system architecture. Use this format in backticks when referring to architecture as a value or parameter.

Cloud providers might use different formats of this term to refer to architectures. If you are documenting code, commands or outputs, then confer with your subject-matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

Examples:

- Specifies the type of architecture for your server, such as x86\_64.
- When specifying the architecture, `x86_64` is a valid value.

Refer also to [64-bit ARM](#a64-bit), [64-bit x86](#a64-bit-x86), [AArch64, aarch64](#aarch64), [AMD64, amd64](#AMD64), [ARM64, arm64](#ARM64), and [Intel 64](#Intel64).

[⁠]()XEmacs

Correct. Do not use "Xemacs." Use "xemacs" only when referring to a command, such as "To start XEmacs, type xemacs."

[⁠]()Xen

Use where it accurately refers to the original Xen version of the package. You can refer to the distributed package as "Xen" if it is essentially the same as the upstream code.

[⁠]()xterm

Correct. Do not use "Xterm" unless the word is used at the beginning of a sentence.

[⁠]()X Windows

Do not use. It is an incorrect reference to the X Window System (or X).

[⁠]()X Window System

Also referred to as X. When making multiple references to the X Window System, the complete reference must appear first, with shortened references following. For example, "Reinstalling the X Window System, or X, is not necessary if ..." "To start an X session, from the shell prompt ..."

[⁠]()YAML

Recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language." Expand on first use only.

[⁠]()you

Use second person wherever possible. Do not use "I", "we", "he", or "she."

[⁠]()you may

Avoid. For example, "you may" can be eliminated from the following sentence: "You may double-click the desktop ..."

[⁠]()zip

*v.* Do not use. Refer to the Word Usage section of [*IBM Style*](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) **![](images/padlock.png)** .

[⁠]()ZIP Code

Use only for an address in the US, a US territory, or the Philippines. Otherwise, use "postal code".
