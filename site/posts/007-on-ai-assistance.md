description: AI assistants are changing coding. Is it still worth the skeptism?

If you even casually browse HackerNews, you probably saw ["My AI Skeptic Friends are all Nuts"](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) and the -raging flame war- heated debate it triggered.

I love HN for all of the skeptics and naysayers; it keeps me grounded and constantly questioning unbridled enthusiasm for AI. However, I am becoming less skeptical by the day as I continue
to improve my systems for working with agents.

My adoption curve went like this:

- 2023: Dabble with ChatGPT to answer questions. Begin deprecating StackOverflow as a resource. Very little coding with AI.
- 2024: Decide to try again with Copilot. Opening VSCode made my physically ill, so I stopped and went back to Neovim. StackOverflow completely forgotten for Claude/ChatGPT.
- Late 2024/2025: Cursor is all the rage. I decided to install it, Zed, & VSCode (again). Super impressed by Cursor especially, but the IDE leaves me wanting.
- Mid 2025: Rediscover [Aider](https://aider.chat/) and how to configure it. Immediately I notice a sea change in code quality.
- Now: Daily driver is Aider but starting to use Claude Code more.

With the help of agents, I have prototyped more at work, shaped ideas, and started (& finished!) a number of small projects. Honestly, it has made the act of coding really exciting again.

If you aren't seeing the benefits, take some time to configure the agent via it's specific rules configuration. Have it help you write it. Configure aggressive linters to hold the agent accountable
to high standards. You may surprise yourself by how much better the experience is.
