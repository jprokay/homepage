description: Using Caddy templates to generate a link feed ala Simon Willison
---
<p>After many futile attempts to start blogging, I decided to start small with link posts and a more freeform feed.</p>

<p>I became a fan of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison's blog</a> and was inspired by his post on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">running a link blog.</a></p>

<p>Thanks to some help from Aider (and a lot of documentation - the AI did a pretty bad job on this one), I finally have a feed all generated from HTML and Caddy configurations</p>
<p>In my next post, I will detail what makes it tick!</p>
