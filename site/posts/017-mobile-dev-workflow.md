  A look at using Terminus, Tailscale, and Claude Code to enable
  productive development sessions from anywhere.

This post was created on my phone while enjoying a banh mi at the Oakland Airport (shout out to Tay Ho!). With my setup I can:

- ssh to my laptop
- run Claude
- code up new features and commit

It took me 30 minutes to setup before leaving for the airport. The magic is thanks to [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh) and [Terminus](https://termius.com/).

Before leaving your house, you'll want to ensure you are authenticated to key 3rd party services. I had to go through the Claude and GitHub authentication flows again. 

Is it the easiest experience to use neovim on a phone? No. Can you write code? Claude handles that part for me 😂
