description: Starting a blog doesn't require Rails, Django, or Astro. You can do it with HTML, CSS, and a bit of Caddy. Start your own Minimal Viable Blog
---

On HackerNews today, there were two articles very relevant to my journey in building out my website.

1. [The Minimum Viable Blog](https://ostwilkens.se/blog/setting-up-blog)
2. [Why can't html alone do includes?](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/seeking-an-answer-why-cant-html-alone-do-includes/)

I was heavily inspired by articles like #1 to start blogging (not this one in particular given the date), but I made it my mission to not reach for Django, Rails, Astro, or really anything outside of HTML. I did not cut my teeth by building webpages, so I wanted to use this opportunity to learn how to do as much as possible with just HTML and CSS.

It did not take me very long to run into the problems listed in article #2. After writing only _one blog post_, I wanted to refactor out the common header and footer elements to their own templates.

Nope, you can't do that with just HTML.

However, I did find a solution using Caddy's built-in features as I detail in my earlier posts. I saved myself from Django or Rails, but I guess I did end up writing a bit of Golang.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
